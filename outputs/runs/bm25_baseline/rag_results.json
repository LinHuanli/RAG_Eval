    "reference_answer": "Institutions that mark to market and manage interest-rate risk on derivative instruments on a discounted-cash-flow basis can, with permission from competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate positions. These models must generate positions with the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows, assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve. The positions calculated using these models shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.",
    "generated_answer": "Institutions with permission from competent authorities can calculate positions for interest rate risk on derivative instruments using sensitivity models, which generate positions that have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. The sensitivity must be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each maturity band. This approach can be used for any bond amortized over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal.",

Article 330 Swaps Swaps shall be treated for interest-rate risk purposes on the same basis as on-balance-sheet instruments. Thus, an interest- rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself. Article 331 Interest rate risk on derivative instruments 1. Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensi­ tivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments. 2. Institutions which do not use models under paragraph 1 may, treat as fully offsetting any positions in derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 which meet the following conditions at least: (a) the positions are of the same value and denominated in the same currency; (b) the reference rate (for floating-rate positions) or coupon (for fixed-rate positions) is closely matched; (c) the next interest-fixing date or, for fixed coupon positions, residual maturity corresponds with the following limits: (i) less than one month hence: same day; (ii) between one month and one year hence: within seven days; (iii) over one year hence: within 30 days. Article 332 Credit Derivatives 1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the 'protection seller'), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwith­ standing the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows: (a) a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation; (b) a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded.

Institutions may apply paragraph 1 only subject to the permission of the competent authorities, which shall be granted if all of the following conditions are met: (a) there is a satisfactory allocation of own funds within the group; (b) the regulatory, legal or contractual framework in which the institutions operate is such as to guarantee mutual financial support within the group. 3. Where there are undertakings located in third countries all of the following conditions shall be met in addition to those in paragraph 2: (a) such undertakings have been authorised in a third country and either satisfy the definition of a credit institution or are recognised third-country investment firms; (b) such undertakings comply, on an individual basis, with own funds requirements equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation; (c) no regulations exist in the third countries in question which might significantly affect the transfer of funds within the group. CHAPTER 2 Own funds requirements for position risk S e c t i o n 1 G e n e r a l p r o v i s i o n s a n d s p e c i f i c i n s t r u m e n t s Article 326 Own funds requirements for position risk The institution's own funds requirement for position risk shall be the sum of the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of its positions in debt and equity instruments. Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments. Article 327 Netting 1. The absolute value of the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calcu­ lating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 328 to 330. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 336. 2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the like­ lihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines. 3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, shall be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggre­ gation. Article 328 Interest rate futures and forwards 1. Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table. 2. For the purposes of this Article, 'long position' means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and 'short position' means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future. Article 329 Options and warrants 1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.

The first shall be its specific risk component and shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The general risk component shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument due in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative to a change in the level of interest rates or in the case of an equity or equity derivative to a broad equity-market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities. Article 363 Permission to use internal models 1. After having verified an institution's compliance with the requirements of Sections 2, 3 and 4 as relevant, competent authorities shall grant permission to institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for one or more of the following risk categories by using their internal models instead of or in combination with the methods in Chapters 2 to 4: (a) general risk of equity instruments; (b) specific risk of equity instruments; (c) general risk of debt instruments; (d) specific risk of debt instruments; (e) foreign-exchange risk; (f) commodities risk. 2. For risk categories for which the institution has not been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 1 to use its internal models, that institution shall continue to calculate own funds requirements in accordance with those Chapters 2, 3 and 4 as relevant. Permission by the competent authorities for the use of internal models shall be required for each risk category and shall be granted only if the internal model covers a significant share of the positions of a certain risk category.

The same calculation shall then be undertaken with regard to that part of the unmatched weighted position in zone two which is left over and the unmatched weighted position in zone three in order to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three. 6. The institution may reverse the order in paragraph 5 so as to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three before calculating that position between zones one and two. 7. The remainder of the unmatched weighted position in zone one shall then be matched with what remains of that for zone three after the latter's matching with zone two in order to derive the matched weighted position between zones one and three. 8. Residual positions, following the three separate matching calculations in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 shall be summed. 9. The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of: (a) 10 % of the sum of the matched weighted positions in all maturity bands; (b) 40 % of the matched weighted position in zone one; (c) 30 % of the matched weighted position in zone two; (d) 30 % of the matched weighted position in zone three; (e) 40 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and two and between zones two and three; (f) 150 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and three; (g) 100 % of the residual unmatched weighted positions. Article 340 Duration-based calculation of general risk 1. Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 339, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis. 2. Under the duration-based approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each fixed-rate debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of floating-rate instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed. 3. The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula: modified duration ¼ D 1 þ R where: D = duration calculated according to the following formula: D ¼ X M t¼1 t · C t ð1 þ RÞ t X M t¼1 C t ð1 þ RÞ t where: R = yield to maturity; C t = cash payment in time t; M = total maturity. Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections. 4. The institution shall then allocate each debt instrument to the appropriate zone in Table 3. It shall do so on the basis of the modified duration of each instrument. Table 3 Zone Modified duration (in years) Assumed interest (change in %) One > 0 ≤ 1,0 1,0 Two > 1,0 ≤ 3,6 0,85 Three > 3,6 0,7 5. The institution shall then calculate the duration-weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest-rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).

The size of a risk position from a credit default swap shall be the notional value of the reference debt instrument multiplied by the remaining maturity of the credit default swap. Article 278 Transactions with a non-linear risk profile 1. Institutions shall determine the size of the risk positions for transactions with a non-linear risk profile in accordance with the following paragraphs. 2. The size of a risk position from an OTC derivative with a non-linear risk profile, including options and swaptions, of which the underlying is not a debt instrument or a payment leg shall be equal to the delta equivalent effective notional value of the financial instrument that underlies the transaction in accordance with Article 280(1). 3. The size of a risk position from an OTC derivative with a non-linear risk profile, including options and swaptions, of which the underlying is a debt instrument or a payment leg, shall be equal to the delta equivalent effective notional value of the financial instrument or payment leg multiplied by the modified duration of the debt instrument or payment leg, as the case may be. Article 279 Treatment of Collateral For the determination of risk positions, institutions shall treat collateral as follows: (a) collateral received from a counterparty shall be treated as a claim on the counterparty under a derivative contract (long position) that is due on the day the determination is made; (b) collateral it has posted with the counterparty shall be treated as an obligation to the counterparty (short position) that is due on the day the determination is made. Article 280 Calculation of risk positions 1. An institution shall determine the size and sign of a risk position as follows: (a) for all instruments other than debt instruments: (i) as the effective notional value in the case of a trans­ action with a linear risk profile; (ii) as the delta equivalent notional value, p ref · ∂V ∂p , in the case of a transaction with a non-linear risk profile, where: P ref = price of the underlying instrument, expressed in the reference currency; V = value of the financial instrument (in the case of an option, the value is the option price); p = price of the underlying instrument, expressed in the same currency as V; (b) for debt instruments and the payment legs of all trans­ actions: (i) as the effective notional value multiplied by the modified duration in the case of a transaction with a linear risk profile; (ii) as the delta equivalent in notional value multiplied by the modified duration, ∂V ∂r , in the case of a transaction with a non-linear risk profile, where: V = value of the financial instrument (in the case of an option this is the option price); r = interest rate level.

Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions: (a) it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position; (b) institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate; (c) if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level. 4. Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter: (a) the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository; (b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a). The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor. CHAPTER 3 Own funds requirements for foreign-exchange risk Article 351 De minimis and weighting for foreign exchange risk If the sum of an institution's overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 352, including for any foreign exchange and gold positions for which own funds requirements are calculated using an internal model, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, the institution shall calculate an own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %. Article 352 Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position 1. The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative): (a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold); (b) the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position; (c) irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable; (d) the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options; (e) the market value of other options. The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying. The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently. The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force. 2. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calcu­ lation of own funds.

When applying the SM, institutions shall calculate the exposure value separately for each netting set, net of collateral, as follows: Exposure value ¼ β · max ( CMV – CMC; X j j X i RPT ij – X l RPC lj j · CCRM j ) where: CMV = current market value of the portfolio of transactions within the netting set with a counterparty gross of collateral, where: CMV ¼ X i CMV i where: CMV i = the current market value of transaction i; CMC = the current market value of the collateral assigned to the netting set, where: CMC ¼ X l CMC l where: CMC l = the current market value of collateral l; i = index designating transaction; l = index designating collateral; j = index designating hedging set category; The hedging sets for this purpose correspond to risk factors for which risk positions of opposite sign can be offset to yield a net risk position on which the exposure measure is then based. RPT ij = risk position from transaction i with respect to hedging set j; RPC lj = risk position from collateral l with respect to hedging set j; CCRM j = CCR Multiplier set out in Table 5 with respect to hedging set j; β = 1,4. 3. For the purposes of the calculation under paragraph 2: (a) eligible collateral received from a counterparty shall have a positive sign and collateral posted to a counterparty shall have a negative sign; (b) only collateral that is eligible under Article 197, Article 198 and Article 299(2)(d) shall be used for the SM; (c) an institution may disregard the interest rate risk from payment legs with a remaining maturity of less than one year; (d) an institution may treat transactions that consist of two payment legs that are denominated in the same currency as a single aggregate transaction. The treatment for payment legs applies to the aggregate transaction. Article 277 Transactions with a linear risk profile 1. Institutions shall map transactions with a linear risk profile to risk positions in accordance with the following provi­ sions: (a) transactions with a linear risk profile with equities (including equity indices), gold, other precious metals or other commodities as the underlying shall be mapped to a risk position in the respective equity (or equity index) or commodity and an interest rate risk position for the payment leg; (b) transactions with a linear risk profile with a debt instrument as the underlying instrument shall be mapped to an interest rate risk position for the debt instrument and another interest rate risk position for the payment leg; (c) transactions with a linear risk profile that stipulate the exchange of payment against payment, including foreign exchange forwards, shall be mapped to an interest rate risk position for each of the payment legs. Where, under a transaction mentioned in point (a), (b) or (c), a payment leg or the underlying debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, that payment leg or underlying instrument shall also be mapped to a risk position in that currency. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the size of a risk position from a transaction with linear risk profile shall be the effective notional value (market price multiplied by quantity) of the underlying financial instruments or commodities converted to the institution's domestic currency by multiplication with the relevant exchange rate, except for debt instruments.

CHAPTER 4 Own funds requirements for commodities risk Article 355 Choice of method for commodities risk Subject to Articles 356 to 358, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for commodities risk with one of the methods set out in Article 359, 360 or 361. Article 356 Ancillary commodities business 1. Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met: (a) at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year; (b) it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a); (c) its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5 % of its own funds or EUR 1 million and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6,5 % of its own funds; (d) the institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality. 2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1. Article 357 Positions in commodities 1. Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency. 2. Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated in accordance with Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calcu­ lating commodities risk. 3. For the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an insti­ tution's long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 358, as positions in the underlying commodity. 4. For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity: (a) positions in different sub-categories of commodities in cases where the sub-categories are deliverable against each other; (b) positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year. Article 358 Particular instruments 1. Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date. 2. Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 359(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.

The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4; (b) an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for tranches appearing pursuant to this Section with a risk weighting of 1 250 %.

By contrast, a programme-wide credit enhancement covering only some of the losses above the seller-provided protection across the various pools generally would constitute a tranching of the risk of a pool of multiple assets containing at least one secu­ ritisation exposure, and would therefore be a re-securiti­ sation exposure. Nevertheless, if such a programme funds itself entirely with a single class of commercial paper, and if either the programme-wide credit enhancement is not a re-securitisation or the commercial paper is fully supported by the sponsoring institution, leaving the commercial paper investor effectively exposed to the default risk of the sponsor instead of the underlying pools or assets, then that commercial paper generally should not be considered a re-securitisation exposure. (65) The provisions on prudent valuation for the trading book should apply to all instruments measured at fair value, whether in the trading book or non- trading book of institutions. It should be clarified that, where the appli­ cation of prudent valuation would lead to a lower carrying value than actually recognised in the accounting, the absolute value of the difference should be deducted from own funds. (66) Institutions should have a choice whether to apply a capital requirement to or deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 items those securitisation positions that receive a 1 250 % risk weight under this Regulation, irrespective of whether the positions are in the trading or the non- trading book. (67) Originator or sponsor institutions should not be able to circumvent the prohibition of implicit support by using their trading books in order to provide such support. (68) Without prejudice to the disclosures explicitly required by this Regulation, the aim of the disclosure requirements should be to provide market participants with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the risk profile of individual institutions. Institutions should therefore be required to disclose additional information not explicitly listed in this Regulation where such disclosure is necessary to meet that aim. At the same time, competent authorities should pay appro­ priate attention to cases where they suspect that information is regarded as proprietary or confidential by an institution in order to avoid disclosure of such information. (69) Where an external credit assessment for a securitisation position incorporates the effect of credit protection provided by the investing institution itself, the institution should not be able to benefit from the lower risk weight resulting from that protection. The securitisation position should not be deducted from capital if there are other ways to determine a risk weight in line with the actual risk of the position which does not take that credit protection into account. (70) Given their recent weak performance, the standards for internal models to calculate market risk capital requirements should be strengthened. In particular, their capture of risks should be completed regarding credit risks in the trading book. Furthermore, capital charges should include a component adequate to stress conditions to strengthen capital requirements in view of deteriorating market conditions and in order to reduce the potential for pro-cyclicality. Institutions should also carry out reverse stress tests to examine what scenarios could challenge the viability of the insti­ tution unless they can prove that such a test is dispensable. Given the recent particular difficulties of treating securitisation positions using approaches based on internal models, the recognition of institutions' modelling of securitisation risks to calculate capital requirements in the trading book should be limited and a standardised capital charge for securitisation positions in the trading book should be required by default. (71) This Regulation lays down limited exceptions for certain correlation trading activities, in accordance with which an institution may be permitted by its supervisor to calculate a comprehensive risk capital charge subject to strict requirements. In such cases the institution should be required to subject those activities to a capital charge equal to the higher of the capital charge in accordance with that internally developed approach and 8 % of the capital charge for specific risk in accordance with the standardised measurement method. It should not be required to subject those exposures to the incremental risk charge but they should be incorporated into both the value-at-risk measures and the stressed value-at-risk measures. (72) In light of the nature and magnitude of unexpected losses experienced by institutions during the financial and economic crisis, it is necessary to improve further the quality and harmonisation of own funds that institutions are required to hold. This should include the introduction of a new definition of the core elements of capital available to absorb unexpected losses as they arise, enhancements to the definition of hybrid capital and uniform prudential adjustments to own funds. It is also necessary to raise significantly the level of own funds, including new capital ratios focusing on the core elements of own funds available to absorb losses as they arise.

An originator institution of a synthetic securitisation may calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, for the securitised exposures in accordance with Article 249, if either of the following is met: (a) significant credit risk is considered to have been transferred to third parties either through funded or unfunded credit protection; (b) the originator institution applies a 1 250 % risk weight to all securitisation positions it holds in this securitisation or deducts these securitisation positions from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with Article 36(1)(k). 2. Significant credit risk shall be considered to have been transferred if either of the following conditions is met: (a) the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the mezzanine secu­ ritisation positions which are held by the originator insti­ tution in this securitisation do not exceed 50 % of the risk weighted exposure amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in this securitisation; (b) where there are no mezzanine securitisation positions in a given securitisation and the originator can demonstrate that the exposure value of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 or a 1 250 % risk weight exceeds a reasoned estimate of the expected loss on the securitised exposures by a substantial margin, the originator institution does not hold more than 20 % of the exposure values of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 or a 1 250 % risk weight; (c) where the possible reduction in risk weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by this securitisation, is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authority may decide on a case- by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered to have been transferred to third parties. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, mezzanine securitisation positions means securitisation positions to which a risk weight lower than 1 250 % applies and that are more junior than the most senior position in this securitisation and more junior than any securitisation positions in this securitisation to which either of the following is assigned in accordance with Section 4: (a) in the case of a securitisation position subject to Section 3, Sub-section 3 a credit quality step 1; (b) in the case of a securitisation position subject to Section 3, Sub-section 4 a credit quality step 1 or 2. 4.

Permission shall be granted only where the institution meets all of the following conditions: (a) the institution has appropriately risk-sensitive policies and methodologies in place to assess the transfer of risk; (b) the institution has also recognised the transfer of credit risk to third parties in each case for purposes of the institution's internal risk management and its internal capital allocation. 5. In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4, as applicable, the transfer shall comply with the following conditions: (a) the securitisation documentation reflects the economic substance of the transaction; (b) the credit protection by which the credit risk is transferred complies with Article 247(2); (c) the instruments used to transfer credit risk do not contain terms or conditions that: (i) impose significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection is deemed not to be triggered if a credit event occurs; (ii) allow for the termination of the protection due to deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying exposures; (iii) other than in the case of early amortisation provisions, require positions in the securitisation to be improved by the originator institution; (iv) increase the institution's cost of credit protection or the yield payable to holders of positions in the securiti­ sation in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying pool; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/153",

        "content": "(57) It is important that the interests of undertakings that 're- package' loans into tradable securities and other financial instruments (originators or sponsors) and undertakings that invest in these securities or instruments (investors) are aligned. To achieve this, the originator or sponsor should retain a significant interest in the underlying assets. It is therefore important for the originators or the sponsors to retain exposure to the risk of the loans in question. More generally, securitisation transactions should not be structured in such a way as to avoid the application of the retention requirement, in particular through any fee or premium structure or both. Such retention should be applicable in all situations where the economic substance of a securitisation is applicable, whatever legal structures or instruments are used to obtain this economic substance. In particular where credit risk is transferred by securitisation, investors should make their decisions only after conducting thorough due diligence, for which they need adequate information about the securitisations. (58) This Regulation also provides that there be no multiple applications of the retention requirement. For any given securitisation it suffices that only the originator, the sponsor or the original lender is subject to the requirement. Similarly, where securitisation transactions contain other securitisations as an underlying, the retention requirement should be applied only to the secu­ ritisation which is subject to the investment. Purchased receivables should not be subject to the retention requirement if they arise from corporate activity where they are transferred or sold at a discount to finance such activity. Competent authorities should apply the risk weight in relation to non-compliance with due diligence and risk management obligations in relation to securitisation for non-trivial breaches of policies and procedures which are relevant to the analysis of the underlying risks. The Commission should also review whether avoidance of multiple applications of the retention requirement could be conducive to practices circumventing the retention requirement and whether the rules on securitisations are enforced effectively by the competent authorities. (59) Due diligence should be used in order to properly assess the risks arising from securitisation exposures for both the trading book and the non-trading book. In addition, due diligence obligations need to be proportionate. Due diligence procedures should contribute to building greater confidence between originators, sponsors and investors. It is therefore desirable that relevant information concerning the due diligence procedures is properly disclosed. (60) When an institution incurs an exposure to its own parent undertaking or to other subsidiaries of its parent under­ taking, particular prudence is necessary. The management of such exposures incurred by institutions should be carried out in a fully autonomous manner, in accordance with the principles of sound management, without regard to any other considerations. This is especially important in the case of large exposures and in cases not simply related to intragroup administration or usual intragroup transactions. Competent authorities should pay particular attention to such intragroup exposures. Such standards need not, however be applied where the parent under­ taking is a financial holding company or a credit insti­ tution or where the other subsidiaries are either credit or financial institutions or undertakings offering ancillary services, provided that all such undertakings are covered by the supervision of the credit institution on a consolidated basis. (61) In view of the risk-sensitivity of the rules relating to capital requirements, it is desirable to keep under review whether these have significant effects on the economic cycle. The Commission, taking into account the contribution of the European Central Bank (ECB), should report on these aspects to the European Parliament and to the Council. (62) The capital requirements for commodity dealers, including those dealers currently exempt from the requirements of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments ( 1 ), should be reviewed. (63) The goal of liberalisation of gas and electricity markets is both economically and politically important for the Union. With this in mind, the capital requirements and other prudential rules to be applied to firms active in those markets should be proportionate and should not unduly interfere with achievement of the goal of liberali­ sation. This goal should, in particular, be kept in mind when reviews of this Regulation are carried out. (64) Institutions investing in re-securitisations should exercise due diligence also with regard to the underlying securiti­ sations and the non-securitisation exposures ultimately underlying the former. Institutions should assess whether exposures in the context of asset-backed commercial paper programmes constitute re-securiti­ sation exposures, including those in the context of programmes which acquire senior tranches of separate pools of whole loans where none of those loans is a securitisation or re-securitisation exposure, and where the first-loss protection for each investment is provided by the seller of the loans. In the latter situation, a pool- specific liquidity facility should generally not be considered a re-securitisation exposure because it represents a tranche of a single asset pool (that is, the EN L 176/8 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013 ( 1 ) OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1.",

Article 395 Limits to large exposures 1. An institution shall not incur an exposure, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to a client or group of connected clients the value of which exceeds 25 % of its eligible capital. Where that client is an institution or where a group of connected clients includes one or more institutions, that value shall not exceed 25 % of the institution's eligible capital or EUR 150 million, whichever the higher, provided that the sum of exposure values, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to all connected clients that are not institutions does not exceed 25 % of the institution's eligible capital. Where the amount of EUR 150 million is higher than 25 % of the institution's eligible capital the value of the exposure, after taking into account the effect of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 shall not exceed a reasonable limit in terms of the institution's eligible capital. That limit shall be determined by the institution in accordance with the policies and procedures referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU, to address and control concentration risk. This limit shall not exceed 100 % of the institution's eligible capital. Competent authorities may set a lower limit than EUR 150 million and shall inform EBA and the Commission thereof. 2. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 as well as the outcomes of developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures at the Union and international levels, issue guidelines by 31 December 2014 to set appropriate aggregate limits to such exposures or tighter individual limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework. In developing those guidelines, EBA shall consider whether the introduction of additional limits would have a material detri­ mental impact on the risk profile of institutions established in the Union, on the provision of credit to the real economy or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets. By 31 December 2015 the Commission shall assess the appro­ priateness and the impact of imposing limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework, taking into account Union and international developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures as well as credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together, if appropriate, with a legislative proposal on exposure limits to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework. 3. Subject to Article 396, an institution shall at all times comply with the relevant limit laid down in paragraph 1. 4. Assets constituting claims and other exposures onto recognised third-country investment firms may be subject to the same treatment as set out in paragraph 1. 5. The limits laid down in this Article may be exceeded for the exposures on the institution's trading book if the following conditions are met: (a) the exposure on the non-trading book to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1, this limit being calculated with reference to eligible capital, so that the excess arises entirely on the trading book; (b) the institution meets an additional own funds requirement on the excess in respect of the limit laid down in paragraph 1 which is calculated in accordance with Articles 397 and 398; (c) where 10 days or less have elapsed since the excess occurred, the trading-book exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question shall not exceed 500 % of the institution's eligible capital; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/231",

In this case, they shall notify the Commission, the Council, the competent authorities concerned and EBA. Approval of the new measures shall be subject to the process set out in this Article. This Article shall be without prejudice to Article 458. Article 396 Compliance with large exposures requirements 1. If, in an exceptional case, exposures exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1), the institution shall report the value of the exposure without delay to the competent authorities which may, where the circumstances warrant it, allow the institution a limited period of time in which to comply with the limit. Where the amount of EUR 150 million referred to in Article 395(1) is applicable, the competent authorities may allow on a case-by-case basis the 100 % limit in terms of the institution's eligible capital to be exceeded. 2. Where compliance by an institution on an individual or sub-consolidated basis with the obligations imposed in this Part is disapplied under Article 7(1), or the provisions of Article 9 are applied in the case of parent institutions in a Member State, measures shall be taken to ensure the satisfactory allocation of risks within the group. Article 397 Calculating additional own funds requirements for large exposures in the trading book 1. The excess referred to in Article 395(5)(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question which attract the highest specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V, the sum of which equals the amount of the excess referred to in point (a) of Article 395(5). 2. Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components. 3. As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V. The additional own funds requirement shall be equal to the sum of the specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or the Article 299 and Part Three, Title V requirements on these components, multiplied by the corresponding factor in Column 2 of Table 1.

Institutions shall maintain systems which ensure that any transfer which has the effect referred to in the first subparagraph is immediately reported to the competent auth­ orities. Article 399 Eligible credit mitigation techniques 1. For the purposes of Articles 400 to 403 the term 'guar­ antee' shall include credit derivatives recognised under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 other than credit linked notes. 2. Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, where, under Articles 400 to 403 the recognition of funded or unfunded credit protection is permitted, this shall be subject to compliance with the eligibility requirements and other requirements set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.

In order to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients, in respect of clients to which the institution has exposures through transactions referred to in points (m) and (o) of Article 112 or through other transactions where there is an exposure to underlying assets, an institution shall assess its underlying exposures taking into account the economic substance of the structure of the transaction and the risks inherent in the structure of the transaction itself, in order to determine whether it constitutes an additional exposure. 8. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following: (a) the conditions and methodologies used to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients in respect of the types of exposures referred to in paragraph 7; (b) the conditions under which the structure of the transaction referred to in paragraph 7 does not constitute an additional exposure. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 391 Definition of an institution for large exposures purposes For the purposes of calculating the value of exposures in accordance with this Part the term 'institution' shall include a private or public undertaking, including its branches, which, were it established in the Union, would fulfil the definition of the term 'institution' and has been authorised in a third country that applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. Article 392 Definition of a large exposure An institution's exposure to a client or group of connected clients shall be considered a large exposure where its value is equal to or exceeds 10 % of its eligible capital. Article 393 Capacity to identify and manage large exposures An institution shall have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms for the purposes of identifying, managing, monitoring, reporting and recording all large exposures and subsequent changes to them, in accordance with this Regulation. Article 394 Reporting requirements 1. An institution shall report the following information about every large exposure to the competent authorities, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1): (a) the identification of the client or the group of connected clients to which an institution has a large exposure; (b) the exposure value before taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation, when applicable; (c) where used, the type of funded or unfunded credit protection; (d) the exposure value after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation calculated for the purpose of Article 395(1). Where an institution is subject to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 its 20 largest exposures on a consolidated basis, excluding those exempted from the application of Article 395(1) shall be made available to the competent authorities. 2. An institution shall report the following information to the competent authorities, in addition to reporting the information referred to in paragraph 1, in relation to its 10 largest exposures on a consolidated basis to institutions as well as its 10 largest exposures on a consolidated basis to unregulated financial entities, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1): (a) the identification of the client or the group of connected clients to which an institution has a large exposure; (b) the exposure value before taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation, when applicable; (c) where used, the type of funded or unfunded credit protection; (d) the exposure value after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation calculated for the purpose of Article 395(1); (e) the expected run-off of the exposure expressed as the amount maturing within monthly maturity buckets up to one year, quarterly maturity buckets up to three years and annually thereafter. 3.

Other Member States may recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article and apply them to domestically authorised branches located in the Member State authorised to apply the measures. 6. Where Member States recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, they shall notify the Council, the Commission, EBA, the ESRB and the Member State authorised to apply the measures. 7. When deciding whether to recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, the Member State shall take into consideration the criteria set in paragraph 4. 8. The Member State authorised to apply the measures may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which do not recognise the measures. 9. Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State shall, in consultation with the ESRB and EBA, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for one additional year each time. After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least annually. 10. Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (vi) and (vii) of paragraph 2(d) of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements in paragraph 2 of this Article are met. Article 459 Prudential requirements The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 462, to impose, for a period of one year, stricter prudential requirements for exposures where this is necessary to address changes in the intensity of microprudential and macroprudential risks which arise from market devel­ opments in the Union or outside the Union affecting all Member States, and where the instruments of this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are not sufficient to address these risks, in particular upon the recommendation or opinion of the ESRB or EBA, concerning: (a) the level of own funds laid down in Article 92; (b) the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403; (c) the public disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 431 to 455. The Commission, assisted by the ESRB shall, at least on an annual basis, submit to the European Parliament and the Council, a report on market developments potentially requiring the use of this Article. Article 460 Liquidity 1. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 462 to specify in detail the general requirement set out in Article 412(1). The delegated act adopted in accordance with this paragraph shall be based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, shall specify under which circumstances competent authorities have to impose specific in- and outflow levels on credit institutions in order to capture specific risks to which they are exposed and shall respect the thresholds set out in paragraph 2. 2. The liquidity coverage requirement referred to in Article 412 shall be introduced in accordance with the following phasing-in: (a) 60 % of the liquidity coverage requirement in 2015; (b) 70 % as from 1 January 2016; (c) 80 % as from 1 January 2017; (d) 100 % as from 1 January 2018. For this purpose the Commission shall take into account the reports referred to in Article 509(1), (2) and (3) and inter­ national standards developed by international fora as well as Union specificities.

        "content": "The estimates produced by the institution shall be sufficiently suitable for reducing the exposure value for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of Article 395. Where an institution is permitted to use its own estimates of the effects of financial collateral, it shall do so on a basis consistent with the approach adopted in the calculation of the own funds requirements in accordance with this Regulation. Institutions permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, which do not calculate the value of their exposures using the method referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the approach set out in Article 403(1)(b) for calculating the value of exposures. 3. An institution that makes use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or is permitted to use the method described in paragraph 2 of this Article in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken. These periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations. The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of such risks. In the event that the periodic stress test indicates a lower real­ isable value of collateral taken than would be permitted to be taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2 as appropriate, the value of collateral permitted to be recognised in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall be reduced accordingly. Institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk: (a) policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures; (b) policies and procedures in the event that a stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral than taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2; (c) policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, and in particular large indirect credit exposures, for example to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral. Article 402 Exposures arising from mortgage lending 1. For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 125(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met: (a) the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a higher risk weight than 35 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by residential real estate in accordance with Article 124(2); (b) the exposure or part of the exposure is fully secured by: (i) mortgages on residential property; or (ii) a residential property in a leasing transaction under which the lessor retains full ownership of the residential property and the lessee has not yet exercised his option to purchase; (c) the requirements in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met. 2. For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 126(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met: (a) the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a higher risk weight than 50 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by commercial real estate in accordance with Article 124(2); (b) the exposure is fully secured by: (i) mortgages on offices or other commercial premises; or (ii) offices or other commercial premises and the exposures related to property leasing transactions; EN L 176/236 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Where an institution relies upon Article 401(2), the recog­ nition of funded credit protection shall be subject to the relevant requirements under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3. For the purposes of this Part, an institution shall not take into account the collateral referred to in Article 199(5) to (7), unless permitted under Article 402. 4. Institutions shall analyse, to the extent possible, their exposures to collateral issuers, providers of unfunded credit protection and underlying assets pursuant to Article 390(7) for possible concentrations and where appropriate take action and report any significant findings to their competent authority. Article 400 Exemptions 1. The following exposures shall be exempted from the application of Article 395(1): (a) asset items constituting claims on central governments, central banks or public sector entities which, unsecured, would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (b) asset items constituting claims on international organi­ sations or multilateral development banks which, unsecured, would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (c) asset items constituting claims carrying the explicit guar­ antees of central governments, central banks, international organisations, multilateral development banks or public sector entities, where unsecured claims on the entity providing the guarantee would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (d) other exposures attributable to, or guaranteed by, central governments, central banks, international organisations, multilateral development banks or public sector entities, where unsecured claims on the entity to which the exposure is attributable or by which it is guaranteed would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) asset items constituting claims on regional governments or local authorities of Member States where those claims would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 and other exposures to or guaranteed by those regional governments or local authorities, claims on which would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (f) exposures to counterparties referred to in Article 113(6) or (7) if they would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2.

Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions: (a) it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position; (b) institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate; (c) if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level. 4. Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter: (a) the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository; (b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).

The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %. Article 352 Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position 1. The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative): (a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold); (b) the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position; (c) irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable; (d) the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options; (e) the market value of other options. The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities.

The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently. The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force. 2. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calcu­ lation of own funds.

In each case in which the limit has been exceeded, the insti­ tution shall report the amount of the excess and the name of the client concerned and, where applicable, the name of the group of connected clients concerned, without delay to the competent authorities. 6. For the purpose of this paragraph, structural measures mean measures adopted by a Member State and implemented by the relevant competent authorities of that Member State before the entry into force of a legal act explicitly harmonising such measures, that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 400(1)(f), where Member States adopt national laws requiring structural measures to be taken within a banking group, competent authorities may require the institutions of the banking group which hold deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes ( 1 ) or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country to apply a large exposure limit below 25 % but not lower than 15 % between 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015, and than 10 % from 1 July 2015 on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) to intragroup exposures where these exposures consist of exposures to an entity that does not belong to the same subgroup as regards the structural measures. For the purpose of this paragraph, the following conditions shall be met: (a) all entities belonging to a same subgroup as regards the structural measures are considered as one client or group of connected clients; (b) the competent authorities apply a uniform limit to the exposures referred to in the first subparagraph. Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail dispro­ portionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. 7. Before adopting the specific structural measures as referred to in paragraph 6 relating to large exposures, the competent authorities shall notify the Council, the Commission, the competent authorities concerned and EBA at least two months prior to the publication of the decision to adopt the structural measures, and submit relevant quantitative or quali­ tative evidence of all of the following: (a) the scope of the activities that are subject to the structural measures; (b) an explanation as to why such draft measures are deemed to be suitable, effective and proportionate to protect depositors; (c) an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State. 8. The power to adopt an implementing act to accept or reject the proposed national measures referred to in paragraph 7 is conferred on the Commission acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 464(2). Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 7, EBA shall provide its opinion on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned. Competent authorities concerned may also provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned. Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust and strong evidence that the measures have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits, the Commission shall, within two months of receiving the notification, reject the proposed national measures. Otherwise, the Commission shall accept the proposed national measures for an initial period of 2 years and where appropriate the measures may be subject to amendment. The Commission shall only reject the proposed national measures if it considers the proposed national measures entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market or to the free movement of capital in accordance with the provisions of the TFEU. The assessment of the Commission shall take account of the opinion of EBA and shall take into account the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 7.

This exemption is available until 31 December 2017 or the date of entry into force of any amendments pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, whichever is the earlier. 2. By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall, on the basis of public consultations and in the light of discussions with the competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and the Council on: (a) an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms whose main business consists exclusively of the provision of investment services or activities in relation to the commodity derivatives or derivatives contracts set out in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; (b) the desirability of amending Directive 2004/39/EC to create a further category of investment firm whose main business consists exclusively of the provision of investment services or activities in relation to the financial instruments set out in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC relating to energy supplies.

(32) Considering the devastating effects of the latest financial crisis the overall objectives of this Regulation are to encourage economically useful banking activities that serve the general interest and to discourage unsustainable financial speculation without real added value. This implies a comprehensive reform of the ways savings are channelled into productive investments. In order to safeguard a sustainable and diverse banking environment in the Union, competent authorities should be empowered to impose higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions that are able, due to their business activities, to pose a threat to the global economy. (33) Equivalent financial requirements for institutions holding money or securities belonging to their clients are necessary to ensure similar safeguards for savers and fair conditions of competition between comparable groups of institutions. (34) Since institutions in the internal market are engaged in direct competition, monitoring requirements should be equivalent throughout the Union taking into account the different risk profiles of the institutions. (35) Whenever in the course of supervision it is necessary to determine the amount of the consolidated own funds of a group of institutions, the calculation should be effected in accordance with this Regulation. (36) According to this Regulation own funds requirements apply on an individual and consolidated basis, unless competent authorities do not apply supervision on an individual basis where they deem this appropriate. Indi­ vidual, consolidated and cross-border consolidated super­ vision are useful tools in overseeing institutions. (37) In order to ensure adequate solvency of institutions within a group it is essential that the capital requirements apply on the basis of the consolidated situation of those institutions within the group. In order to ensure that own funds are appropriately distributed within the group and available to protect savings where needed, the capital requirements should apply to individual insti­ tutions within a group, unless this objective can be effec­ tively achieved otherwise. (38) The minority interests arising from intermediate financial holding companies that are subject to the requirements of this Regulation on a sub-consolidated basis may also be eligible, within the relevant limits, as Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the group on a consolidated basis, as the Common Equity Tier 1 capital of an intermediate financial holding company attributable to minority interests and the part of that same capital attributable to the parent company support both pari passu the losses of their subsidiaries when they occur. (39) The precise accounting technique to be used for the calculation of own funds, their adequacy for the risk to which an institution is exposed, and for the assessment of the concentration of exposures should take account of the provisions of Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial insti­ tutions ( 1 ), which incorporates certain adaptations of the provisions of Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 on consolidated accounts ( 2 ) or of Regu­ lation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards ( 3 ), whichever governs the accounting of the institutions under national law. (40) For the purposes of ensuring adequate solvency it is important to lay down capital requirements which weight assets and off-balance sheet items according to the degree of risk. (41) On 26 June 2004 the BCBS adopted a framework agreement on the international convergence of capital measurement and capital requirements ('Basel II frame­ work').

        "content": "(13) In areas not covered by this Regulation, such as dynamic provisioning, provisions on national covered bonds schemes not related to the treatment of covered bonds under the rules established by this Regulation, acquisition and holding of participations in both the financial and non-financial sector for purposes not related to prudential requirements specified in this Regulation, competent authorities or Member States should be able to impose national rules, provided that they are not inconsistent with this Regulation. (14) The most important recommendations advocated in the de Larosière report and later implemented in the Union were the establishment of a singlerulebook and a European framework for macroprudential supervision where both elements in combination were aimed at ensuring financial stability. The single rulebook ensures a robust and uniform regulatory framework facilitating the functioning of the internal market and prevents regu­ latory arbitrage opportunities. Within the internal market for financial services, macroprudential risks may however differ in a number of ways with a range of national specificities resulting in variances being observed for example with regard to the structure and size of the banking sector compared to the wider economy and the credit cycle. (15) A number of tools to prevent and mitigate macropru­ dential and systemic risks have been built into this Regu­ lation and Directive 2013/36/EU ensuring flexibility while at the same time ensuring that the use of those tools are subject to appropriate control in order not to harm the function of the internal market while also ensuring that the use of such tools is transparent and consistent. (16) Beyond the systemic risk buffer tool included in Directive 2013/36/EU, where macroprudential or systemic risks concern a Member State, the competent or designated authorities of the relevant Member State should have the possibility to address those risks by certain specific national macroprudential measures, when this is considered more effective to tackle those risks. The European Systemic Risk Board (\"ESRB\") established by Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 ( 1 ) and the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (\"EBA\") established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 ( 2 ) should have the opportunity to provide their opinions on whether the conditions for such national macroprudential measures are met and there should be a Union mechanism to prevent national measures from proceeding, where there is very strong evidence that the relevant conditions are not satisfied. Whilst this Regu­ lation establishes uniform microprudential rules for insti­ tutions, Member States retain a leading role in macro­ prudential oversight because of their expertise and their existing responsibilities in relation to financial stability. In that specific case, since the decision to adopt any national macroprudential measures includes certain assessments in relation to risks which may ultimately affect the macroeconomic, fiscal and budgetary situation of the relevant Member State, it is necessary that the power to reject the proposed national macro­ prudential measures is conferred on the Council in accordance with Article 291 TFEU, acting on a proposal by the Commission. (17) Where the Commission has submitted to the Council a proposal to reject national macroprudential measures, the Council should examine that proposal without delay and decide whether or not to reject the national measures. A vote could be taken in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Council ( 3 ) at the request of a Member State or of the Commission. In accordance with Article 296 TFEU, the Council should state the reasons for its decision with respect to the conditions laid down in this Regulation for its intervention. Considering the importance of the macroprudential and systemic risk for the financial market of the Member State concerned and therefore the need for rapid reaction, it is important that the time limit for such a Council decision is set to one month. If the Council, after having examined the proposal by the Commission to reject the proposed national measures in depth, comes to the conclusion that the conditions laid down in this Regulation for the rejection of the national measures were not fulfilled, it should always provide its reasons in a clear and unambiguous manner. (18) Until the harmonisation of liquidity requirements in 2015 and the harmonisation of a leverage ratio in 2018, Member States should be able to apply such measures as they consider appropriate, including measures to mitigate macroprudential or systemic risk in a specific Member State. (19) It should be possible to apply systemic risk buffers or individual measures taken by Member States to address systemic risks concerning those Member States, to the banking sector in general or to one or more subsets of the sector, meaning subsets of institutions that exhibit similar risk profiles in their business activities, or to the exposures to one or several domestic economic or geographic sectors across the banking sector.

That declaration also called for introduction of a supplementary non-risk based measure to contain the build-up of leverage in the banking system, and the development of a framework for stronger liquidity buffers. In response to the mandate given by the G-20, in September 2009 the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), agreed on a number of measures to strengthen the regulation of the banking sector. Those measures were endorsed by the G-20 leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit of 24-25 September 2009 and were set out in detail in December 2009. In July and September 2010, GHOS issued two further announcements on design and calibration of those new measures, and in December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published the final measures, that are referred to as the Basel III framework. (2) The High Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de Larosière (the \"de Larosière group\") invited the Union to develop a more harmonised set of financial regulations. In the context of the future European supervisory architecture, the European Council of 18 and 19 June 2009 also stressed the need to establish a 'European Single Rule Book' applicable to all credit institutions and investment firms in the internal market. (3) As stated in the de Larosière group's report of 25 February 2009 (the \"de Larosière report\"), \"a Member State should be able to adopt more stringent national regulatory measures considered to be domes­ tically appropriate for safeguarding financial stability as long as the principles of the internal market and agreed minimum core standards are respected\".

By 30 June 2014, the Commission shall, after consulting the ESRB and EBA, review whether the macroprudential rules contained in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are sufficient to mitigate systemic risks in sectors, regions and Member States including assessing: (a) whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regu­ lation and Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent; (b) whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules; (c) how internationally agreed standards for systemic insti­ tutions interacts with the provisions in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards. 2. By 31 December 2014, the Commission shall, on the basis of the consultation with the ESRB and EBA, report to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 and, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council. Article 514 Counterparty Credit Risk and the Original Exposure Method By 31 December 2016 the Commission shall review and report on the application of Article 275 and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, and, if appropriate, a legislative proposal.

        "content": "(20) If two or more Member States' designated authorities identify the same changes in the intensity of systemic or macroprudential risk posing a risk to financial stability at the national level in each Member State which the designated authorities consider would better be addressed by means of national measures, the Member States may submit a joint notification to the Council, the Commission, the ESRB and EBA. When notifying the Council, the Commission, the ESRB and EBA Member States should submit relevant evidence, including a justification of the joint notification. (21) The Commission should furthermore be empowered to adopt a delegated act temporarily increasing the level of own funds requirements, requirements for large exposures and public disclosure requirements. Such provisions should be applicable for a period of one year, unless the European Parliament or the Council has objected to the delegated act within a period of three months. The Commission should state the reasons for the use of such a procedure. The Commission should only be empowered to impose stricter prudential requirements for exposures which arise from market developments in the Union or outside the Union affecting all Member States. (22) A review of the macroprudential rules is justified in order for the Commission to assess, among other things, whether the macroprudential tools in this Regulation or Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and trans­ parent, whether new instruments should be proposed, whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap of the macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation or Directive 2013/36/EU are appropriate and how internationally agreed standards for systemically important institutions interacts with this Regulation or Directive 2013/36/EU. (23) Where Member States adopt guidelines of general scope, in particular in areas where the adoption by the Commission of draft technical standards is pending, those guidelines shall neither contradict Union law nor undermine its application. (24) This Regulation does not prevent Member States from imposing, where appropriate, equivalent requirements on undertakings that do not fall within its scope. (25) The general prudential requirements set out in this Regu­ lation are supplemented by individual arrangements that are decided by the competent authorities as a result of their ongoing supervisory review of individual institu­ tions. The range of such supervisory arrangements should, inter alia, be set out in Directive 2013/36/EU since the competent authorities should be able to exert their judgment as to which arrangements should be imposed. (26) This Regulation should not affect the ability of competent authorities to impose specific requirements under the supervisory review and evaluation process set out in Directive 2013/36/EU that should be tailored to the specific risk profile of institutions. (27) Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 aims at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision and strengthening oversight of cross-border groups. (28) Given the increase in the number of tasks conferred on EBA by this Regulation and by Directive 2013/36/EU, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that adequate human and financial resources are made available without delay. (29) Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 requires EBA to act within the scope of Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC. EBA is also required to act in the field of activities of institutions in relation to issues not directly covered in those Directives, provided that such actions are necessary to ensure the effective and consistent appli­ cation of those Directives. This Regulation should take into account the role and function of EBA and facilitate the exercise of EBA's powers set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. (30) After the observation period and the full implementation of a liquidity coverage requirement in accordance with this Regulation, the Commission should assess whether granting EBA a power of initiative to intervene with binding mediation in relation to the reaching of joint decisions by the competent authorities under Articles 20 and 21 of this Regulation would facilitate the practical formation and operation of single liquidity sub-groups as well as the determination of whether criteria for a specific intragroup treatment for cross- border institutions are met. Therefore, at that time, as part of one of the regular reports on the operation of EBA under Article 81 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the Commission should specifically examine the need to grant EBA such powers and include the results of this examination in its report, which should be accompanied by appropriate legislative proposals, where appropriate.

After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least annually. 10. Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (vi) and (vii) of paragraph 2(d) of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements in paragraph 2 of this Article are met. Article 459 Prudential requirements The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 462, to impose, for a period of one year, stricter prudential requirements for exposures where this is necessary to address changes in the intensity of microprudential and macroprudential risks which arise from market devel­ opments in the Union or outside the Union affecting all Member States, and where the instruments of this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are not sufficient to address these risks, in particular upon the recommendation or opinion of the ESRB or EBA, concerning: (a) the level of own funds laid down in Article 92; (b) the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403; (c) the public disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 431 to 455. The Commission, assisted by the ESRB shall, at least on an annual basis, submit to the European Parliament and the Council, a report on market developments potentially requiring the use of this Article. Article 460 Liquidity 1. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 462 to specify in detail the general requirement set out in Article 412(1).

Article 253 Treatment of unrated positions 1. For the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of an unrated securitisation position an institution may apply the weighted-average risk weight that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures, multiplied by the concentration ratio referred to in paragraph 2.

Article 252 Originator and sponsor institutions For an originator institution or sponsor institution, the risk- weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its securiti­ sation positions in any one securitisation may be limited to the risk-weighted exposure amounts which would currently be calculated for the securitised exposures had they not been securitised subject to the presumed application of a 150 % risk weight to the following: (a) all items currently in default; (b) all items associated with particularly high risk in accordance with Article 128 amongst the securitised exposures. Article 253 Treatment of unrated positions 1. For the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of an unrated securitisation position an institution may apply the weighted-average risk weight that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures, multiplied by the concentration ratio referred to in paragraph 2. For this purpose, the institution shall know the composition of the pool of securitised exposures securitised at all times. 2. The concentration ratio shall be equal to the sum of the nominal amounts of all the tranches divided by the sum of the nominal amounts of the tranches junior to or pari passu with the tranche in which the position is held including that tranche itself. The resulting risk weight shall not be higher than 1 250 % or lower than any risk weight applicable to a rated more senior tranche. Where the institution is unable to determine the risk weights that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2, it shall apply a risk weight of 1 250 % to the position. Article 254 Treatment of securitisation positions in a second loss tranche or better in an ABCP programme Subject to the availability of a more favourable treatment for unrated liquidity facilities under Article 255 an institution may apply to securitisation positions meeting the following conditions a risk weight that is the greater of 100 % or the highest of the risk weights that would be applied to any of the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures: (a) the securitisation position shall be in a tranche which is economically in a second loss position or better in the securitisation and the first loss tranche shall provide mean­ ingful credit enhancement to the second loss tranche; (b) the quality of the securitisation position shall be equivalent to credit quality step 3 under the Standardised Approach or better; (c) the securitisation position shall be held by an institution which does not hold a position in the first loss tranche.

The aggregated exposure values treated by this exception shall not be material and in any case less than 10 % of the aggregate exposure values treated by the insti­ tution under the Internal Assessment Approach. The insti­ tution shall stop making use of this when the permission for the relevant Internal Assessment Approach has been refused. 2. For the purposes of using inferred ratings, an institution shall attribute to an unrated position an inferred credit assessment equivalent to the credit assessment of a rated reference position which is the most senior position which is in all respects subordinate to the unrated securitisation position in question and meets all of the following conditions: (a) the reference positions shall be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitisation position; (b) the maturity of the reference positions shall be equal to or longer than that of the unrated position in question; (c) on an ongoing basis, any inferred rating shall be updated to reflect any changes in the credit assessment of the reference positions.

An institution may recognise funded or unfunded credit protection obtained in respect of a securitisation position in accordance with Chapter 4 and subject to the requirements laid down in this Chapter and in Chapter 4. Eligible funded credit protection is limited to financial collateral which is eligible for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 as laid down under Chapter 4 and recognition is subject to compliance with the relevant requirements as laid down under Chapter 4. 2. Eligible unfunded credit protection and unfunded credit protection providers are limited to those which are eligible under Chapter 4 and recognition is subject to compliance with the relevant requirements laid down under Chapter 4. 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the eligible providers of unfunded credit protection listed in points (a) to (h) of Article 201(1) except for qualifying central counterparties shall have a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI which has been determined to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under Article 136 and shall have been associated with credit quality step 2 or above at the time the credit protection was first recognised. Institutions that have a permission to apply the IRB Approach to a direct exposure to the protection provider may assess eligibility according to the first sentence based on the equivalence of the PD for the protection provider to the PD associated with the credit quality steps referred to in Article 136. 4. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, SSPEs are eligible protection providers where they own assets that qualify as eligible financial collateral and to which there are no rights or contingent rights preceding or ranking pari passu to the contingent rights of the institution receiving unfunded credit protection and all requirements for the recognition of financial collateral in Chapter 4 are fulfilled.

By contrast, a programme-wide credit enhancement covering only some of the losses above the seller-provided protection across the various pools generally would constitute a tranching of the risk of a pool of multiple assets containing at least one secu­ ritisation exposure, and would therefore be a re-securiti­ sation exposure. Nevertheless, if such a programme funds itself entirely with a single class of commercial paper, and if either the programme-wide credit enhancement is not a re-securitisation or the commercial paper is fully supported by the sponsoring institution, leaving the commercial paper investor effectively exposed to the default risk of the sponsor instead of the underlying pools or assets, then that commercial paper generally should not be considered a re-securitisation exposure. (65) The provisions on prudent valuation for the trading book should apply to all instruments measured at fair value, whether in the trading book or non- trading book of institutions. It should be clarified that, where the appli­ cation of prudent valuation would lead to a lower carrying value than actually recognised in the accounting, the absolute value of the difference should be deducted from own funds. (66) Institutions should have a choice whether to apply a capital requirement to or deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 items those securitisation positions that receive a 1 250 % risk weight under this Regulation, irrespective of whether the positions are in the trading or the non- trading book. (67) Originator or sponsor institutions should not be able to circumvent the prohibition of implicit support by using their trading books in order to provide such support. (68) Without prejudice to the disclosures explicitly required by this Regulation, the aim of the disclosure requirements should be to provide market participants with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the risk profile of individual institutions. Institutions should therefore be required to disclose additional information not explicitly listed in this Regulation where such disclosure is necessary to meet that aim. At the same time, competent authorities should pay appro­ priate attention to cases where they suspect that information is regarded as proprietary or confidential by an institution in order to avoid disclosure of such information. (69) Where an external credit assessment for a securitisation position incorporates the effect of credit protection provided by the investing institution itself, the institution should not be able to benefit from the lower risk weight resulting from that protection. The securitisation position should not be deducted from capital if there are other ways to determine a risk weight in line with the actual risk of the position which does not take that credit protection into account. (70) Given their recent weak performance, the standards for internal models to calculate market risk capital requirements should be strengthened. In particular, their capture of risks should be completed regarding credit risks in the trading book. Furthermore, capital charges should include a component adequate to stress conditions to strengthen capital requirements in view of deteriorating market conditions and in order to reduce the potential for pro-cyclicality. Institutions should also carry out reverse stress tests to examine what scenarios could challenge the viability of the insti­ tution unless they can prove that such a test is dispensable. Given the recent particular difficulties of treating securitisation positions using approaches based on internal models, the recognition of institutions' modelling of securitisation risks to calculate capital requirements in the trading book should be limited and a standardised capital charge for securitisation positions in the trading book should be required by default. (71) This Regulation lays down limited exceptions for certain correlation trading activities, in accordance with which an institution may be permitted by its supervisor to calculate a comprehensive risk capital charge subject to strict requirements. In such cases the institution should be required to subject those activities to a capital charge equal to the higher of the capital charge in accordance with that internally developed approach and 8 % of the capital charge for specific risk in accordance with the standardised measurement method. It should not be required to subject those exposures to the incremental risk charge but they should be incorporated into both the value-at-risk measures and the stressed value-at-risk measures. (72) In light of the nature and magnitude of unexpected losses experienced by institutions during the financial and economic crisis, it is necessary to improve further the quality and harmonisation of own funds that institutions are required to hold. This should include the introduction of a new definition of the core elements of capital available to absorb unexpected losses as they arise, enhancements to the definition of hybrid capital and uniform prudential adjustments to own funds. It is also necessary to raise significantly the level of own funds, including new capital ratios focusing on the core elements of own funds available to absorb losses as they arise.

The weights shall be the stand-alone own funds charges for credit risk and dilution risk respectively. 2. Where the nominal amount of the largest securitised exposure, C 1 , is no more than 3 % of the sum of the nominal amount of the securitised exposures, then, for the purposes of the Supervisory Formula Method, the institution may set LGD= 50 % in the case of securitisations, which are not re-securitisations, and N equal to either of the following: N ¼ 8 > > :C 1 · C m þ 8 > > : C m – C 1 m – 1 9 > > ; · max n 1 – m · C 1 ,0 o 9 > > ; –1 N ¼ 1 C 1 where: C m = the ratio of the sum of the nominal amounts of the largest 'm' exposures to the sum of the nominal amounts of the exposures securitised. The level of 'm' may be set by the institution. For securitisations in which materially all securitised exposures are retail exposures, institutions may, subject to permission by the competent authority, use the Supervisory Formula Method using the simplifications h=0 and v=0, provided that the effective number of exposures is not low and that the exposures are not highly concentrated. 3. The competent authorities shall keep EBA informed about the use institutions make of paragraph 2.

The highest risk weight that would be applied under Chapter 2 to any of the securitised exposures, had they not been securitised, may be applied to the securitisation position represented by a liquidity facility that meets the conditions in Article 255(1). To determine the exposure value of the position a conversion factor of 100 % shall be applied. Article 264 Credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions subject to the IRB Approach 1. Where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Ratings Based Method, the exposure value or the risk-weight for a securitisation position in respect of which credit protection has been obtained may be amended in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2. 2. In the case of full credit protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, the following requirements shall apply: (a) the institution shall determine the 'effective risk weight' of the position. It shall do this by dividing the risk-weighted exposure amount of the position by the exposure value of the position and multiplying the result by 100; (b) in the case of funded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the funded protection-adjusted exposure amount of the position (E*), as calculated under Chapter 4 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the secu­ ritisation position to be E, by the effective risk weight; (c) in the case of unfunded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch and maturity mismatch (GA) in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 by the risk weight of the protection provider; and adding this to the amount arrived at by multiplying the amount of the securitisation position minus GA by the effective risk weight. 3. In the case of partial protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, the following requirements shall apply: (a) if the credit risk mitigation covers the first loss or losses on a proportional basis on the securitisation position, the insti­ tution may apply paragraph 2; (b) in other cases, the institution shall treat the securitisation position as two or more positions with the uncovered portion being considered the position with the lower credit quality. For the purposes of calculating the risk- weighted exposure amount for this position, the provisions in Article 262 shall apply subject to the adjustment of T to e* in the case of funded credit protection and to T-g in the case of unfunded credit protection, where e* denotes the ratio of E* to the total notional amount of the underlying pool, where E* is the adjusted exposure amount of the securitisation position calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the securitisation position to be E; and g is the ratio of the nominal amount of credit protection, adjusted for any currency or maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4, to the sum of the exposure amounts of the securitised exposures. In the case of unfunded credit protection the risk weight of the protection provider shall be applied to that portion of the position not falling within the adjusted value of T. 4. Where, in the case of unfunded credit protection, competent authorities have granted the institution permission to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Chapter 3, the risk weight g of exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Article 235 shall be determined as specified in Chapter 3. Article 265 Additional own funds requirements for securitisations of revolving exposures with early amortisation provisions 1. In addition to the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its securitisation positions, an originator institution shall calculate a risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with the methodology set out in Article 256 when it sells revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision. 2. By way of derogation from Article 256, the exposure value of the originators interest shall be the sum of the following items: (a) the exposure value of that notional part of a pool of drawn amounts sold into a securitisation, the proportion of which in relation to the amount of the total pool sold into the structure determines the proportion of the cash flows generated by principal and interest collections and other associated amounts which are not available to make payments to those having securitisation positions in the securitisation; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/165",

In order to take account of price volatility, institutions shall apply volatility adjustments to the market value of collateral, as set out in Articles 224 to 227, when valuing financial collateral for the purposes of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method. Where collateral is denominated in a currency that differs from the currency in which the underlying exposure is denominated, institutions shall add an adjustment reflecting currency volatility to the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral as set out in Articles 224 to 227. In the case of OTC derivatives transactions covered by netting agreements recognised by the competent authorities under Chapter 6, institutions shall apply a volatility adjustment reflecting currency volatility when there is a mismatch between the collateral currency and the settlement currency. Even where multiple currencies are involved in the transactions covered by the netting agreement, institutions shall apply a single volatility adjustment. 2. Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (C VA ) they need to take into account as follows: C VA ¼ C · Ä 1 – H C – H fx Ö where: C = the value of the collateral; H C = the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227; EN L 176/140 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

TITLE V OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTLEMENT RISK Article 378 Settlement/delivery risk In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase trans­ actions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed. The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution. The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appro­ priate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other non-trading book exposure, on the basis of the counter­ party's external rating. Institutions using own estimates of 'LGDs' may apply the LGD set out in Article 161(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures. If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.

For their purchased corporate receivables institutions shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184. For purchased corporate receivables that comply in addition with the conditions set out in Article 154(5), and where it would be unduly burdensome for an institution to use the risk quantifi­ cation standards for corporate exposures as set out in Section 6 for these receivables, the risk quantification standards for retail exposures as set out in Section 6 may be used. 7. For purchased corporate receivables, refundable purchase discounts, collateral or partial guarantees that provide first-loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as first-loss positions under the IRB securitisation framework. 8. Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, if the product has an external credit assessment from an ECAI the risk weights set out in Chapter 5 shall be applied. If the product is not rated by an ECAI, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggre­ gated, excluding n-1 exposures where the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative multiplied by 12,5.

TITLE VI OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT RISK Article 381 Meaning of Credit Valuation Adjustment For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title II, 'Credit Valuation Adjustment' or 'CVA' means an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty. That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty. Article 382 Scope 1. An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk. 2. An institution shall include securities financing trans­ actions in the calculation of own funds required by paragraph 1 if the competent authority determines that the institution's CVA risk exposures arising from those transactions are material. 3. Transactions with a qualifying central counterparty and a client's transactions with a clearing member, when the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the client and a qualifying central counterparty and the transactions give rise to a trade exposure of the clearing member to the qualifying central counterparty, are excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk. 4. The following transactions shall be excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk: (a) transactions with non-financial counterparties as defined in point (9) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, or with non-financial counterparties established in a third country, where those transactions do not exceed the clearing threshold as specified in Article 10(3) and (4) of that Regulation; (b) intragroup transactions as provided for in Article 3 of Regu­ lation (EU) No 648/2012 unless Member States adopt national laws requiring the structural separation within a banking group, in which case competent authorities may require those intragroup transactions between the struc­ turally separated institutions to be included in the own funds requirements; (c) transactions with counterparties referred to in point (10) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and subject to the transitional provisions set out in Article 89(1) of that Regulation until those transitional provisions cease to apply; (d) transactions with counterparties referred to in Article 1(4)(a) and (b) and Article 1(5)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and transactions with counterparties for which Article 115 of this Regulation specifies a risk weight of 0 % for exposures to those counterparties. The exemption from the CVA charge for those transactions referred to in point (c) of this paragraph) which are entered into during the transitional period laid down in Article 89(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall apply for the length of the contract of that transaction. 5. EBA shall conduct a review by 1 January 2015 and every two years thereafter, in the light of international regulatory developments and including on potential methodologies on the calibration and thresholds for application of CVA charges to non-financial counterparties established in a third country. EBA in cooperation with ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the procedures for excluding transactions with non-financial counterparties established in a third country from the own funds requirement for CVA risk.

Options and warrants on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying. Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds require­ ments. 4. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013. 5. Where an institution is either of the following, it shall include the commodities concerned in the calculation of its own funds requirement for commodities risk: (a) the transferor of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities in a repurchase agreement; (b) the lender of commodities in a commodities lending agreement. Article 359 Maturity ladder approach 1. The institution shall use a separate maturity ladder in line with Table 1 for each commodity. All positions in that commodity shall be assigned to the appropriate maturity bands. Physical stocks shall be assigned to the first maturity band between 0 and up to and including 1 month. Table 1 Maturity band (1) Spread rate (in %) (2) 0 ≤ 1 month 1,50 > 1 ≤ 3 months 1,50 > 3 ≤ 6 months 1,50 > 6 ≤ 12 months 1,50 > 1 ≤ 2 years 1,50 > 2 ≤ 3 years 1,50 > 3 years 1,50 2. Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following: (a) positions in contracts maturing on the same date; (b) positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates. 3. The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band. 4. That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position. 5. The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following: (a) the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity; (b) the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity; EN L 176/214 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Article 356 Ancillary commodities business 1. Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met: (a) at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year; (b) it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a); (c) its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5 % of its own funds or EUR 1 million and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6,5 % of its own funds; (d) the institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality. 2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1. Article 357 Positions in commodities 1. Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency. 2. Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated in accordance with Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calcu­ lating commodities risk. 3. For the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an insti­ tution's long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 358, as positions in the underlying commodity. 4. For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity: (a) positions in different sub-categories of commodities in cases where the sub-categories are deliverable against each other; (b) positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year. Article 358 Particular instruments 1. Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date. 2. Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 359(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.

Where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk- measurement model, the institution shall be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent auth­ ority. The risk- measurement model shall capture nonlin­ earities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held. 2. Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements: (a) the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off- balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves; (b) the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an insti­ tution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3); (c) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions; (d) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant posi­ tions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions; (e) the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scen­ arios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or port­ folio. 3.

The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, being responsible for the overall risk management system. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits; (c) the institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution's overall risk exposure; (d) the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading, risk- control, audit and back-office areas; EN L 176/218 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

In Tables 1 to 4 of paragraph 1 and in paragraphs 4 to 6, the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated is the credit quality step with which the credit assessment is determined by EBA to be associated under Chapter 2. For the purpose of determining the credit quality step with which a credit assessment of the debt security is associated referred to in the first subparagraph, Article 197(7) also applies. 4. For non-eligible securities or for commodities lent or sold under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the volatility adjustment is the same as for non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange. 5. For eligible units in CIUs the volatility adjustment is the weighted average volatility adjustments that would apply, having regard to the liquidation period of the transaction as specified in paragraph 2, to the assets in which the fund has invested. Where the assets in which the fund has invested are not known to the institution, the volatility adjustment is the highest vola­ tility adjustment that would apply to any of the assets in which the fund has the right to invest. 6.

The competent authorities shall permit institutions to use their own volatility estimates for calculating the volatility adjustments to be applied to collateral and exposures where those institutions comply with the requirements set out in para­ graphs 2 and 3. Institutions which have obtained permission to use their own volatility estimates shall not revert to the use of other methods except for demonstrated good cause and subject to the permission of the competent authorities. For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to investment grade or better, institutions may calculate a volatility estimate for each category of security. For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to below investment grade, and for other eligible collateral, institutions shall calculate the volatility adjustments for each individual item. Institutions using the Own Estimates Approach shall estimate volatility of the collateral or foreign exchange mismatch without taking into account any correlations between the unsecured exposure, collateral or exchange rates. In determining relevant categories, institutions shall take into account the type of issuer of the security, the external credit assessment of the securities, their residual maturity, and their modified duration. Volatility estimates shall be representative of the securities included in the category by the institution. 2.

For these purposes, the calculation of the exposure value may reflect eligible funded credit protection in a manner consistent with Article 257. Where an originator institution makes use of this alternative, it may subtract 12.5 times the amount deducted in accordance with Article 36(1)(k) from the amount specified in Article 252 as the risk-weighted exposure amount which would currently be calculated for the securitised exposures had they not been securitised.

Institutions shall use the methods in accordance with the following hierarchy: (a) for a rated position or a position in respect of which an inferred rating may be used, the Ratings Based Method set out in Article 261 shall be used to calculate the risk- weighted exposure amount; (b) for an unrated position the institution may use the Super­ visory Formula Method set out in Article 262 where it can produce estimates of PD, and where applicable exposure value and LGD as inputs into the Supervisory Formula Method in accordance with the requirements for the esti­ mation of those parameters under the Internal Ratings Based approach in accordance with Section 3. An institution other than the originator institution may only use the Supervisory Formula Method subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, which shall only be granted where the institution fulfils the condition provided in the first sentence of this point; (c) as an alternative to point (b) and only for unrated positions in ABCP programmes, the institution may use the Internal Assessment Approach as set out in paragraph 4 if the competent authorities have permitted it to do so; (d) in all other cases, a risk weight of 1 250 % shall be assigned to securitisation positions which are unrated; (e) notwithstanding point (d), and subject to the prior permission by the competent authorities, an institution may calculate the risk weight for an unrated position in an ABCP programme in accordance with Article 253 or 254, if the unrated position is not in commercial paper and falls within the scope of application of an Internal Assessment Approach for which permission is being sought. The aggregated exposure values treated by this exception shall not be material and in any case less than 10 % of the aggregate exposure values treated by the insti­ tution under the Internal Assessment Approach. The insti­ tution shall stop making use of this when the permission for the relevant Internal Assessment Approach has been refused. 2. For the purposes of using inferred ratings, an institution shall attribute to an unrated position an inferred credit assessment equivalent to the credit assessment of a rated reference position which is the most senior position which is in all respects subordinate to the unrated securitisation position in question and meets all of the following conditions: (a) the reference positions shall be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitisation position; (b) the maturity of the reference positions shall be equal to or longer than that of the unrated position in question; (c) on an ongoing basis, any inferred rating shall be updated to reflect any changes in the credit assessment of the reference positions.

The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate. As techniques and best practices for internal validation evolve, institutions shall apply these advances. Internal model validation shall not be limited to back-testing, but shall, at a minimum, also include the following: (a) tests to demonstrate that any assumptions made within the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk; (b) in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, insti­ tutions shall carry out their own internal model validation tests, including back-testing, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios; (c) the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example material basis risks and concen­ tration risk. 2.

Article 193 Principles for recognising the effect of credit risk mitigation techniques 1. No exposure in respect of which an institution obtains credit risk mitigation shall produce a higher risk-weighted exposure amount or expected loss amount than an otherwise identical exposure in respect of which an institution has no credit risk mitigation. 2. Where the risk-weighted exposure amount already takes account of credit protection under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, institutions shall not take into account that credit protection in the calculations under this Chapter.

        "content": "(f) to the extent that an institution associates or maps its internal grades to the scale used by an ECAI or similar organisations and then attributes the default rate observed for the external organisation's grades to the institution's grades, mappings shall be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or incon­ sistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data shall be avoided. The criteria of the external organisation underlying the data used for quantification shall be oriented to default risk only and not reflect transaction characteristics. The analysis undertaken by the institution shall include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in Article 178. The institution shall document the basis for the mapping; (g) to the extent that an institution uses statistical default prediction models it is allowed to estimate PDs as the simple average of default-probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade. The institution's use of default probability models for this purpose shall meet the standards specified in Article 174; (h) irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data is relevant, this longer period shall be used. This point also applies to the PD/LGD Approach to equity. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions which have not received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGDs or conversion factors may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years. 2. For retail exposures, the following requirements shall apply: (a) institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade or pool from long run averages of one-year default rates; (b) PD estimates may also be derived from an estimate of total losses and appropriate estimates of LGDs; (c) institutions shall regard internal data for assigning exposures to grades or pools as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Institutions may use external data (including pooled data) or statistical models for quan­ tification provided the following strong links both exist: (i) between the institution's process of assigning exposures to grades or pools and the process used by the external data source; and (ii) between the institution's internal risk profile and the composition of the external data; (d) if an institution derives long run average estimates of PD and LGD for retail from an estimate of total losses and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for esti­ mating total losses shall meet the overall standards for esti­ mation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in point (a) of Article 181(1); (e) irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal or pooled data sources or a combination of the three, for their estimation of loss characteristics, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation spans a longer period for any source, and these data are relevant, this longer period shall be used. An institution need not give equal importance to historic data if more recent data is a better predictor of loss rates. Subject to the permission of the competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall increase by one year each year until relevant data cover a period of five years; (f) institutions shall identify and analyse expected changes of risk parameters over the life of credit exposures (seasoning effects).

For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), the assignment process shall meet the following requirements of integrity: (a) Assignments and periodic reviews of assignments shall be completed or approved by an independent party that does not directly benefit from decisions to extend the credit; (b) Institutions shall review assignments at least annually and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. High risk obligors and problem exposures shall be subject to more frequent review. Institutions shall undertake a new assignment if material information on the obligor or exposure becomes available; (c) An institution shall have an effective process to obtain and update relevant information on obligor characteristics that affect PDs, and on transaction characteristics that affect LGDs or conversion factors. 2. For retail exposures, an institution shall at least annually review obligor and facility assignments and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment, or review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool, whichever applicable. An institution shall also at least annually review in a representative sample the status of indi­ vidual exposures within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool, and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. 3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards for the methodologies of the competent authorities to assess the integrity of the assignment process and the regular and inde­ pendent assessment of risks. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 174 Use of models If an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, the following requirements shall be met: (a) the model shall have good predictive power and capital requirements shall not be distorted as a result of its use. The input variables shall form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. The model shall not have material biases; EN L 176/110 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

        "content": "(88) The Commission should review the relevant exemptions for large exposures by 31 December 2015. Pending the outcome of that review, Member States should continue being allowed to decide on the exemption of certain large exposures from those rules for a sufficiently long transitional period. Building on the work done in the context of the preparation and negotiation of Directive 2009/111/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 amending Directives 2006/48/EC, 2006/49/EC and 2007/64/EC as regards banks affiliated to central institutions, certain own funds items, large exposures, supervisory arrangements, and crisis management ( 1 ) and taking into account inter­ national and Union developments on those issues, the Commission should review whether those exemptions should continue to be applied in a discretionary or in a more general way and on whether the risks related to those exposures are addressed by other effective means laid down in this Regulation. (89) In order to ensure that exemptions of exposures by competent authorities do not jeopardise the coherence of the uniform rules established by this Regulation on a permanent basis, after a transitional period, and in the absence of any outcome of that review, the competent authorities should consult EBA on whether or not it is appropriate to continue making use of the possibility to exempt certain exposures. (90) The years preceding the financial crisis were characterised by an excessive build up in institutions' exposures in relation to their own funds (leverage). During the financial crisis, losses and the shortage of funding forced institutions to reduce significantly their leverage over a short period of time. This amplified downward pressures on asset prices, causing further losses for insti­ tutions which in turn led to further declines in their own funds. The ultimate results of this negative spiral were a reduction in the availability of credit to the real economy and a deeper and longer crisis. (91) Risk-based own funds requirements are essential to ensure sufficient own funds to cover unexpected losses. However, the crisis has shown that those requirements alone are not sufficient to prevent institutions from taking on excessive and unsustainable leverage risk. (92) In September 2009, the G-20 leaders committed to developing internationally-agreed rules to discourage an excessive leverage. To that end, they supported the intro­ duction of a leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the Basel II framework. (93) In December 2010, the BCBS published guidelines defining the methodology for calculating the leverage ratio. Those rules provide for an observation period that will run from 1 January 2013 until 1 January 2017 during which the leverage ratio, its components and its behaviour relative to the risk-based requirement will be monitored. Based on the results of the obser­ vation period the BCBS intends to make any final adjustments to the definition and calibration of the leverage ratio in the first half of 2017, with a view to migrating to a binding requirement on 1 January 2018 based on appropriate review and calibration. The BCBS guidelines also provide for disclosure of the leverage ratio and its components starting from 1 January 2015. (94) A leverage ratio is a new regulatory and supervisory tool for the Union. In line with international agreements, it should be introduced first as an additional feature that can be applied on individual institutions at the discretion of supervisory authorities. Reporting obligations for insti­ tutions would allow appropriate review and calibration, with a view to migrating to a binding measure in 2018. (95) When reviewing the impact of the leverage ratio on different business models, particular attention should be paid to business models which are considered to entail low risk, such as mortgage lending and specialised lending with regional governments, local authorities or public sector entities. EBA, on the basis of data received and the findings of the supervisory review during an observation period, should in cooperation with competent authorities develop a classification of business models and risks. Based on appropriate analysis, and also taking into account historical data or stress scenarios, there should be an assessment of the appropriate levels of the leverage ratio that safeguard the resilience of the respective business models and whether the levels of the leverage ratio should be set as thresholds or ranges. After the observation period and the calibration of the respective levels of the leverage ratio, and on the basis of the assessment, EBA can publish an appropriate statistical review, including averages and standard deviations, of the leverage ratio. After adoption of the leverage ratio requirements, EBA should publish an appropriate statistical review, including averages and standard deviations, of the leverage ratio in relation to the identified categories of institutions. (96) Institutions should monitor the level and changes in the leverage ratio as well as leverage risk as part of the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). Such monitoring should be included in the supervisory review process. In particular, after the entry into force of the leverage ratio requirements, competent authorities should monitor the developments in the business model and corresponding risk profile in order to ensure up to date and proper classification of institutions.

        "content": "(e) to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction char­ acteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades; (f) significant concentrations within a single facility grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the facility grade covers a reasonably narrow LGD band, respectively, and that the risk posed by all exposures in the grade falls within that band. 2. Institutions using the methods set out in 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures are exempt from the requirement to have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default for these exposures. These institutions shall have for these exposures at least 4 grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one grade for defaulted obligors. 3. The structure of rating systems for retail exposures shall comply with the following requirements: (a) rating systems shall reflect both obligor and transaction risk, and shall capture all relevant obligor and transaction char­ acteristics; (b) the level of risk differentiation shall ensure that the number of exposures in a given grade or pool is sufficient to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the grade or pool level. The distribution of exposures and obligors across grades or pools shall be such as to avoid excessive concentrations; (c) the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools shall provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and shall allow for accurate and consistent estimation of loss char­ acteristics at grade or pool level. For purchased receivables the grouping shall reflect the seller's underwriting practices and the heterogeneity of its customers. 4. Institutions shall consider the following risk drivers when assigning exposures to grades or pools: (a) obligor risk characteristics; (b) transaction risk characteristics, including product or collateral types or both. Institutions shall explicitly address cases where several exposures benefit from the same collateral; (c) delinquency, except where an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authority that delinquency is not a material driver of risk for the exposure. Article 171 Assignment to grades or pools 1. An institution shall have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools within a rating system that comply with the following requirements: (a) the grade or pool definitions and criteria shall be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign obligors or facilities posing similar risk to the same grade or pool. This consistency shall exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations; (b) the documentation of the rating process shall allow third parties to understand the assignments of exposures to grades or pools, to replicate grade and pool assignments and to evaluate the appropriateness of the assignments to a grade or a pool; (c) the criteria shall also be consistent with the institution's internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled obligors and facilities. 2. An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information. Article 172 Assignment of exposures 1. For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria: (a) each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process; (b) for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/109",

Article 388 Negative Scope This Part shall not apply to investment firms that fulfil the criteria set out in Article 95(1) or Article 96(1). This Part shall not apply to a group on the basis of its consolidated situation, if that group only includes investment firms referred to in Article 95(1) or Article 96(1) and ancillary companies and where that group does not include credit insti­ tutions. Article 389 Definition For the purposes of this Part, 'exposures', means any asset or off-balance sheet item referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2, without applying the risk weights or degrees of risk. Article 390 Calculation of the exposure value 1. Exposures arising from the items referred to in Annex II shall be calculated in accordance with one of the methods set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6. 2. Institutions with a permission to use the Internal Model Method in accordance with Article 283 may use the Internal Model Method for calculating the exposure value for repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, margin lending transactions and long settlement transactions. 3. The institutions that calculate the own funds requirements for their trading-book business in accordance with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2, Article 299 and Part Three, Title V and, as appropriate, with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5, shall calculate the exposures to individual clients which arise on the trading book by adding together the following items: (a) the positive excess of an institution's long positions over its short positions in all the financial instruments issued by the client in question, the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated according to the methods laid down in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2; (b) the net exposure, in the case of the underwriting of a debt or an equity instrument; (c) the exposures due to the transactions, agreements and contracts referred to in Articles 299 and 378 to 380 with the client in question, such exposures being calculated in the manner laid down in those Articles, for the calculation of exposure values. For the purposes of point (b), the net exposure is calculated by deducting those underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of a formal agreement reduced by the factors set out in Article 345. For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall set up systems to monitor and control their underwriting exposures between the time of the initial commitment and the next business day in the light of the nature of the risks incurred in the markets in question. For the purposes of point (c), Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 shall be excluded from the reference in Article 299. 4. The overall exposures to individual clients or groups of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures of the trading book and those of the non-trading book. 5. The exposures to groups of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures to individual clients in a group. 6. Exposures shall not include any of the following: (a) in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two working days following payment; (b) in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during five working days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever the earlier; (c) in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking or financial instruments clearing, settlement and custody services to clients, delayed receipts in funding and other exposures arising from client activity which do not last longer than the following business day; (d) in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking, intra-day exposures to institutions providing those services; (e) exposures deducted from own funds in accordance with Articles 36, 56 and 66.

Parent institutions in a Member State shall comply, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in Article 18, with the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Part Seven on the basis of their consolidated situation. The parent under­ takings and their subsidiaries subject to this Regulation shall set up a proper organisational structure and appropriate internal control mechanisms in order to ensure that the data required for consolidation are duly processed and forwarded. In particular, they shall ensure that subsidiaries not subject to this Regulation implement arrangements, processes and mech­ anisms to ensure a proper consolidation. 2. Institutions controlled by a parent financial holding company or a parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State shall comply, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in Article 18, with the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Part Seven on the basis of the consolidated situation of that financial holding company or mixed financial holding company. Where more than one institution is controlled by a parent financial holding company or by a parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State, the first subparagraph shall apply only to the institution to which supervision on a consolidated basis applies in accordance with Article 111 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 3. EU parent institutions and institutions controlled by an EU parent financial holding company and institutions controlled by an EU parent mixed financial holding company shall comply with the obligations laid down in Part Six on the basis of the consolidated situation of that parent institution, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company, if the group comprises one or more credit institutions or investment firms that are authorised to provide the investment services and activities listed in points (3) and (6) of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC. Pending the report from the Commission in accordance with Article 508(2), and if the group comprises only investment firms, competent authorities may exempt investment firms from compliance with the obligations laid down in Part Six on a consolidated basis, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the investment firm's activ­ ities. 4. Where Article 10 is applied, the central body referred to in that Article shall comply with the requirements of Parts Two to Eight on the basis of the consolidated situation of the whole as constituted by the central body together with its affiliated institutions. 5. In addition to the requirements in paragraphs 1 to 4, and without prejudice to other provisions of this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU, when it is justified for supervisory purposes by the specificities of the risk or of the capital structure of an institution or where Member States adopt national laws requiring the structural separation of activities within a banking group, competent authorities may require the structurally separated institutions to comply with the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Parts Six to Eight of this Regulation and in Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU on a sub-consolidated basis. Applying the approach set out in the first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall neither entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole nor form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. Article 12 Financial holding company or mixed financial holding company with both a subsidiary credit institution and a subsidiary investment firm Where a financial holding company or a mixed financial holding company has at least one credit institution and one investment firm as subsidiaries, the requirements that apply on the basis of the consolidated situation of the financial holding company or of the mixed financial holding company shall apply to the credit institution.

Institutions shall carry out more frequent monitoring where the market is subject to significant changes in conditions; (d) the loan agreement shall include detailed descriptions of the collateral as well as detailed specifications of the manner and frequency of revaluation; (e) institutions shall clearly document in internal credit policies and procedures available for examination the types of physical collateral they accept and the policies and practices they have in place in respect of the appropriate amount of each type of collateral relative to the exposure amount; (f) institutions' credit policies with regard to the transaction structure shall address the following: (i) appropriate collateral requirements relative to the exposure amount; (ii) the ability to liquidate the collateral readily; (iii) the ability to establish objectively a price or market value; (iv) the frequency with which the value can readily be obtained, including a professional appraisal or valu­ ation; (v) the volatility or a proxy of the volatility of the value of the collateral. (g) when conducting valuation and revaluation, institutions shall take fully into account any deterioration or obsol­ escence of the collateral, paying particular attention to the effects of the passage of time on fashion- or date-sensitive collateral; (h) institutions shall have the right to physically inspect the collateral. They shall also have in place policies and procedures addressing their exercise of the right to physical inspection; (i) the collateral taken as protection shall be adequately insured against the risk of damage and institutions shall have in place procedures to monitor this. Article 211 Requirements for treating lease exposures as collateralised Institutions shall treat exposures arising from leasing trans­ actions as collateralised by the type of property leased, where all the following conditions are met: (a) the conditions set out in Article 208 or 210, as applicable, for the type of property leased to qualify as eligible collateral are met; (b) the lessor has in place robust risk management with respect to the use to which the leased asset is put, its location, its age and the planned duration of its use, including appro­ priate monitoring of the value of the security; (c) the lessor has legal ownership of the asset and is able to exercise its rights as owner in a timely fashion; (d) where this has not already been ascertained in calculating the LGD level, the difference between the value of the unamortised amount and the market value of the security is not so large as to overstate the credit risk mitigation attributed to the leased assets.

Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall use E* as calculated under Article 223(5) as the exposure value for the purposes of Article 113. In the case of off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I, institutions shall use E* as the value to which the percentages indicated in Article 111(1) shall be applied to arrive at the exposure value. 2. Under the IRB Approach, institutions shall use the effective LGD (LGD*) as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3. Institutions shall calculate LGD* as follows: LGD ä ¼ LGD · E ä E where: LGD = the LGD that would apply to the exposure under Chapter 3 where the exposure was not collateralised; E = the exposure value in accordance with Article 223(3); E* = the fully adjusted exposure value in accordance with Article 223(5). Article 229 Valuation principles for other eligible collateral under the IRB Approach 1. For immovable property collateral, the collateral shall be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the market value. An institution shall require the independent valuer to document the market value in a transparent and clear manner. In those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions the property may instead be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the mortgage lending value. Institutions shall require the independent valuer not to take into account speculative elements in the assessment of the mortgage lending value and to document that value in a trans­ parent and clear manner. The value of the collateral shall be the market value or mortgage lending value reduced as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3) and to take account of any prior claims on the property. 2. For receivables, the value of receivables shall be the amount receivable. 3. Institutions shall value physical collateral other than immovable property at its market value. For the purposes of this Article, the market value is the estimated amount for which the property would exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length trans­ action.

Where the ratio of the value of the collateral (C) to the exposure value (E) is below the required minimum collateralisation level of the exposure (C*) as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be the LGD laid down in Chapter 3 for uncollateralised exposures to the counterparty. For this purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor or percentage of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs. Where the ratio of the value of the collateral to the exposure value exceeds a second, higher threshold level of C** as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be that prescribed in Table 5. Where the required level of collateralisation C** is not achieved in respect of the exposure as a whole, institutions shall consider the exposure to be two exposures — one corresponding to the part in respect of which the required level of collateralisation C** is achieved and one corresponding to the remainder. 2.

        "content": "(42) It is essential to take account of the diversity of insti­ tutions in the Union by providing alternative approaches to the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk incorporating different levels of risk-sensitivity and requiring different degrees of sophistication. Use of external ratings and institutions' own estimates of indi­ vidual credit risk parameters represents a significant enhancement in the risk-sensitivity and prudential soundness of the credit risk rules. Institutions should be encouraged to move towards the more risk-sensitive approaches. In producing the estimates needed to apply the approaches to credit risk of this Regulation, insti­ tutions should enhance their credit risk measurement and management processes to make available methods for determining regulatory own funds requirements that reflect the nature, scale, and complexity of individual institutions' processes. In this regard, the processing of data in connection with the incurring and management of exposures to customers should be considered to include the development and validation of credit risk management and measurement systems. That serves not only to fulfil the legitimate interests of institutions but also the purpose of this Regulation, to use better methods for risk measurement and management and also use them for regulatory own funds purposes. Notwithstanding this, the more risk-sensitive approaches require considerable expertise and resources as well as data of high quality and sufficient volume. Institutions should therefore comply with high standards before applying those approaches for regulatory own funds purposes. Given the ongoing work on ensuring appro­ priate backstops to internal models, the Commission should prepare a report on the possibility of extending the Basel I floor together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate. (43) The capital requirements should be proportionate to the risks addressed. In particular the reduction in risk levels deriving from having a large number of relatively small exposures should be reflected in the requirements. (44) Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of the pillars of the Union economy given their funda­ mental role in creating economic growth and providing employment. The recovery and future growth of the Union economy depends largely on the availability of capital and funding to SMEs established in the Union to carry out the necessary investments to adopt new technologies and equipment to increase their competi­ tiveness. The limited amount of alternative sources of funding has made SMEs established in the Union even more sensitive to the impact of the banking crisis. It is therefore important to fill the existing funding gap for SMEs and ensure an appropriate flow of bank credit to SMEs in the current context. Capital charges for exposures to SMEs should be reduced through the appli­ cation of a supporting factor equal to 0,7619 to allow credit institutions to increase lending to SMEs. To achieve this objective, credit institutions should effectively use the capital relief produced through the application of the supporting factor for the exclusive purpose of providing an adequate flow of credit to SMEs established in the Union. Competent authorities should monitor periodically the total amount of exposures to SMEs of credit institutions and the total amount of capital deduction. (45) In line with the decision of the BCBS, as endorsed by the GHOS on 10 January 2011, all additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments of an institution should be capable of being fully and permanently written down or converted fully into Common Equity Tier 1 capital at the point of non-viability of the institution. Necessary legislation to ensure that own funds instruments are subject to the additional loss absorption mechanism should be incor­ porated into Union law as part of the requirements in relation to the recovery and resolution of institutions. If by 31 December 2015, Union law governing the requirement that capital instruments should be capable of being fully and permanently written down to zero or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments in the event that an institution is no longer considered viable has not been adopted, the Commission should review and report on whether such a provision should be included in this Regulation and, in light of that review, submit appropriate legislative proposals. (46) The provisions of this Regulation respect the principle of proportionality, having regard in particular to the diversity in size and scale of operations and to the range of activities of institutions. Respect for the principle of proportionality also means that the simplest possible rating procedures, even in the Internal Ratings Based Approach ('IRB Approach'), are recognised for retail exposures. Member States should ensure that the requirements laid down in this Regulation apply in a manner proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks associated with an institution's business model and activities. The Commission should ensure that delegated and implementing acts, regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards are consistent with the principle of proportionality, so as to guarantee that this Regulation is applied in a propor­ tionate manner. EBA should therefore ensure that all regulatory and implementing technical standards are drafted in such a way that they are consistent with and uphold the principle of proportionality. (47) Competent authorities should pay appropriate attention to cases where they suspect that information is regarded as proprietary or confidential in order to avoid disclosure of such information. Although an institution may opt not to disclose information as the information is regarded as proprietary or confidential, the fact that information is being regarded as proprietary or confidential should not discharge liability arising from non-disclosure of that information when such non- disclosure is found to have material effect.

Article 258 Reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts Where a securitisation position is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight, institutions may in accordance with Article 36(1)(k), as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 capital the exposure value of the position. For these purposes, the calculation of the exposure value may reflect eligible funded credit protection in a manner consistent with Article 257. Where an originator institution makes use of this alternative, it may subtract 12.5 times the amount deducted in accordance with Article 36(1)(k) from the amount specified in Article 252 as the risk-weighted exposure amount which would currently be calculated for the securitised exposures had they not been securitised.

Institutions shall use the methods in accordance with the following hierarchy: (a) for a rated position or a position in respect of which an inferred rating may be used, the Ratings Based Method set out in Article 261 shall be used to calculate the risk- weighted exposure amount; (b) for an unrated position the institution may use the Super­ visory Formula Method set out in Article 262 where it can produce estimates of PD, and where applicable exposure value and LGD as inputs into the Supervisory Formula Method in accordance with the requirements for the esti­ mation of those parameters under the Internal Ratings Based approach in accordance with Section 3. An institution other than the originator institution may only use the Supervisory Formula Method subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, which shall only be granted where the institution fulfils the condition provided in the first sentence of this point; (c) as an alternative to point (b) and only for unrated positions in ABCP programmes, the institution may use the Internal Assessment Approach as set out in paragraph 4 if the competent authorities have permitted it to do so; (d) in all other cases, a risk weight of 1 250 % shall be assigned to securitisation positions which are unrated; (e) notwithstanding point (d), and subject to the prior permission by the competent authorities, an institution may calculate the risk weight for an unrated position in an ABCP programme in accordance with Article 253 or 254, if the unrated position is not in commercial paper and falls within the scope of application of an Internal Assessment Approach for which permission is being sought. The aggregated exposure values treated by this exception shall not be material and in any case less than 10 % of the aggregate exposure values treated by the insti­ tution under the Internal Assessment Approach. The insti­ tution shall stop making use of this when the permission for the relevant Internal Assessment Approach has been refused. 2. For the purposes of using inferred ratings, an institution shall attribute to an unrated position an inferred credit assessment equivalent to the credit assessment of a rated reference position which is the most senior position which is in all respects subordinate to the unrated securitisation position in question and meets all of the following conditions: (a) the reference positions shall be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitisation position; (b) the maturity of the reference positions shall be equal to or longer than that of the unrated position in question; (c) on an ongoing basis, any inferred rating shall be updated to reflect any changes in the credit assessment of the reference positions.

Institutions shall develop and document specific policies and criteria for mapping the relevant indicator for current business lines and activities into the standardised framework set out in Article 317. They shall review and adjust those policies and criteria as appropriate for new or changing business activities and risks. 2. Institutions shall apply the following principles for business line mapping: (a) institutions shall map all activities into the business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner; (b) institutions shall allocate any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary activity to an activity included in the framework, to the business line it supports. Where more than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, institutions shall use an objective-mapping criterion; (c) where an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then institutions shall use the business line yielding the highest percentage. The same business line equally applies to any ancillary activity associated with that activity; (d) institutions may use internal pricing methods to allocate the relevant indicator between business lines. Costs generated in one business line which are imputable to a different business line may be reallocated to the business line to which they pertain; (e) the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes shall be consistent with the categories institutions use for credit and market risks; (f) senior management shall be responsible for the mapping policy under the control of the management body of the institution; (g) institutions shall subject the mapping process to business lines to independent review. 3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to determine the conditions of application of the principles for business line mapping provided in this Article. EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2017. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the imple­ menting technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 319 Alternative Standardised Approach 1. Under the Alternative Standardised Approach, for the business lines 'retail banking' and 'commercial banking', insti­ tutions shall apply the following: (a) the relevant indicator is a normalised income indicator equal to the nominal amount of loans and advances multiplied by 0,035; (b) the loans and advances consist of the total drawn amounts in the corresponding credit portfolios. For the 'commercial banking' business line, institutions shall also include securities held in the non trading book in the nominal amount of loans and advances.

EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1). The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4. The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall consider whether, and if, to what extent standby credit facilities referred to in point (e) of Article 416(1) should be included as liquid assets in light of international development and taking into account European specificities, including the way monetary policy is performed in the Union. EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions: (a) minimum trade volume of the assets; (b) minimum outstanding volume of the assets; (c) transparent pricing and post-trade information; (d) credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) proven record of price stability; (f) average volume traded and average trade size; (g) maximum bid/ask spread; (h) remaining time to maturity; (i) minimum turnover ratio. 5. By 31 January 2014, EBA shall furthermore report on the following: (a) uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality; (b) the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which: (i) a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise insti­ tutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations; (ii) regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation; (iii) the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments; (c) the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments. Article 510 Net Stable Funding Requirements 1. By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending.

Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concen­ trations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly. 3. The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1: (a) the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products; (b) credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects; (c) volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations; (d) basis risk, including both of the following: (i) the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names; (ii) the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios; (e) recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; (f) to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges; (g) any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio. 4. An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article.

The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission. 5. With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incor­ porated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scen­ arios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institu­ tion's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio. EN L 176/222 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

The latter alternative may be used only subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted if those estimates meet the quantitative requirements for the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Title II, Chapter 3. In accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA shall issue guidelines on the use of estimates of PD and LGD as inputs when those estimates are based on an IRC approach. 3. For securitisation positions that are subject to an additional risk weight in accordance with Article 407, 8 % of the total risk weight shall be applied. Except for securitisation positions treated in accordance with Article 338(4), the institution shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of this Article (regardless of whether they are long or short) in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk. 4. By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, for a transitional period ending 31 December 2014, the institution shall sum separately its weighted net long positions and its weighted net short positions. The larger of those sums shall constitute the specific risk own funds requirement.

Where an originator institution of a traditional securiti­ sation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer in Article 243, it shall include in the calculation of the own funds requirement under this Article the securitised exposures instead of its securitisation positions from this securitisation. Where an originator institution of a synthetic securitisation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer in Article 244, it shall include in the calculation of the own funds requirement under this Article the securitised exposures from this securitisation, but not any credit protection obtained for the securitised portfolio. Article 338 Own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio 1. The correlation trading portfolio shall consist of securiti­ sation positions and n-th-to-default credit derivatives that meet all of the following criteria: (a) the positions are neither re-securitisation positions, nor options on a securitisation tranche, nor any other derivatives of securitisation exposures that do not provide a pro-rata share in the proceeds of a securitisation tranche; (b) all reference instruments are either of the following: (i) single-name instruments, including single-name credit derivatives, for which a liquid two-way market exists; (ii) commonly-traded indices based on those reference entities. A two-way market is deemed to exist where there are inde­ pendent bona fide offers to buy and sell so that a price reasonably related to the last sales price or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined within one day and settled at such price within a relatively short time conforming to trade custom. 2. Positions which reference any of the following shall not be part of the correlation trading portfolio: (a) an underlying that is capable of being assigned to the exposure class 'retail exposures' or to the exposure class 'exposures' secured by mortgages on immovable property' under the Standardised Approach for credit risk in an insti­ tution's non-trading book; (b) a claim on a special purpose entity, collateralised, directly or indirectly, by a position that would itself not be eligible for inclusion in the correlation trading portfolio in accordance with paragraph 1 and this paragraph. 3. An institution may include in the correlation trading portfolio positions which are neither securitisation positions nor n-th-to-default credit derivatives but which hedge other positions of that portfolio, provided that a liquid two-way market as described in the last subparagraph of paragraph 1 exists for the instrument or its underlyings. 4. An institution shall determine the larger of the following amounts as the specific risk own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio: (a) the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net long positions of the correlation trading portfolio; (b) the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net short positions of the correlation trading portfolio.

EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Article 293 Requirements for the risk management system 1. An institution shall comply with the following require­ ments: (a) it shall meet the qualitative requirements set out in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5; (b) it shall conduct a regular programme of back-testing, comparing the risk measures generated by the model with realised risk measures, and hypothetical changes based on static positions with realised measures; (c) it shall carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic review of its CCR exposure model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review shall be independent of the model development; (d) the management body and senior management shall be involved in the risk control process and shall ensure that adequate resources are devoted to credit and counterparty credit risk control. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit established in accordance Article 287(1)(a) shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the overall risk exposure of the institution; (e) the internal risk measurement exposure model shall be inte­ grated into the day-to-day risk management process of the institution; (f) the risk measurement system shall be used in conjunction with internal trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits shall be related to the institution's risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management; (g) an institution shall ensure that its risk management system is well documented. In particular, it shall maintain a docu­ mented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system, and arrangements to ensure that those policies are complied with; (h) an independent review of the risk measurement system shall be carried out regularly in the institution's own internal auditing process. This review shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management process shall take place at regular intervals (and no less than once a year) and shall specifically address, as a minimum, all items referred to in Article 288; (i) the on-going validation of counterparty credit risk models, including back-testing, shall be reviewed periodically by a level of management with sufficient authority to decide the action that will be taken to address weaknesses in the models. 2. Competent authorities shall take into account the extent to which an institution meets the requirements of paragraph 1 when setting the level of alpha, as set out in Article 284(4). Only those institutions that comply fully with those requirements shall be eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor. 3. An institution shall document the process for initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and the calcu­ lation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of detail that would enable a third party to recreate, respectively, the analysis and the risk measures. That documentation shall set out the frequency with which back testing analysis and any other on-going validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used. 4. An institution shall define criteria with which to assess its CCR exposure models and the models that input into the calcu­ lation of exposure and maintain a written policy that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied. 5. An institution shall define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for the purposes of validating an CCR exposure model and its risk measures. 6. The validation of CCR exposure models and their risk measures that produce forecast distributions shall consider more than a single statistic of the forecast distribution. Article 294 Validation requirements 1. As part of the initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and its risk measures, an institution shall ensure that the following requirements are met: (a) the institution shall carry out back-testing using historical data on movements in market risk factors prior to the permission by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1). That back-testing shall consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various initialisation dates and covering a wide range of market conditions; EN L 176/184 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

        "content": "2. The institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been using a model to calculate the distribution of exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets, broadly, the requirements set out in this Section for at least one year prior to permission to use the IMM by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283. 3. The model used to generate a distribution of exposures to CCR shall be part of the CCR management framework required by Article 286. This framework shall include the measurement of usage of credit lines, aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and internal capital allocation. 4. In addition to EPE, an institution shall measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral. The use test is satisfied if an institution uses other CCR measures, such as peak exposure, based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same model to compute EPE. 5. An institution shall have the systems capability to estimate EE daily if necessary, unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authorities that its exposures to CCR warrant less frequent calculation. The institution shall estimate EE along a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts and in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposures. 6. Exposure shall be measured, monitored and controlled over the life of all contracts in the netting set and not only to the one-year horizon. The institution shall have procedures in place to identify and control the risks for counterparties where the exposure rises beyond the one-year horizon. The forecast increase in exposure shall be an input into the institu­ tion's internal capital model. Article 290 Stress testing 1. An institution shall have a comprehensive stress testing programme for CCR, including for use in assessment of own funds requirements for CCR, which complies with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10. 2. It shall identify possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on an institution's credit exposures and assess the institution's ability to withstand such changes. 3. The stress measures under the programme shall be compared against risk limits and considered by the institution as part of the process set out in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 4. The programme shall comprehensively capture trades and aggregate exposures across all forms of counterparty credit risk at the level of specific counterparties in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing. 5. It shall provide for at least monthly exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors such as interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices for all counter­ parties of the institution, in order to identify, and enable the institution when necessary to reduce outsized concentrations in specific directional risks. Exposure stress testing -including single factor, multifactor and material non-directional risks- and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness shall be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group and aggregate institution-wide CCR levels. 6. It shall apply at least quarterly multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material non-directional risks including yield curve exposure and basis risks. Multiple-factor stress tests shall, at a minimum, address the following scenarios in which the following occurs: (a) severe economic or market events have occurred; (b) broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; (c) a large financial intermediary is liquidating positions. 7. The severity of the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be sufficiently severe to capture historical extreme market environments and extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The stress tests shall evaluate the impact of such shocks on own funds, own funds requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day portfolio moni­ toring, hedging, and management of concentrations the testing programme shall also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability. 8. The programme shall include provision, where appro­ priate, for reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes. Reverse stress testing shall account for the impact of material non-linearity in the portfolio. 9. The results of the stress testing under the programme shall be reported regularly, at least on a quarterly basis, to senior management. The reports and analysis of the results shall cover the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends.

EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1). The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4.

EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions: (a) minimum trade volume of the assets; (b) minimum outstanding volume of the assets; (c) transparent pricing and post-trade information; (d) credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) proven record of price stability; (f) average volume traded and average trade size; (g) maximum bid/ask spread; (h) remaining time to maturity; (i) minimum turnover ratio. 5. By 31 January 2014, EBA shall furthermore report on the following: (a) uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality; (b) the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which: (i) a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise insti­ tutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations; (ii) regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation; (iii) the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments; (c) the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments. Article 510 Net Stable Funding Requirements 1. By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending.

Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments. Article 327 Netting 1. The absolute value of the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calcu­ lating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 328 to 330. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 336. 2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the like­ lihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines. 3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, shall be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggre­ gation. Article 328 Interest rate futures and forwards 1. Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table. 2. For the purposes of this Article, 'long position' means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and 'short position' means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future. Article 329 Options and warrants 1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.

Competent authorities shall report to EBA a list of the contractual cross-product netting agreements approved. Netting across transactions entered into by different legal entities of a group shall not be recognised for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements. Article 296 Recognition of contractual netting agreements 1. Competent authorities shall recognise a contractual netting agreement only where the conditions in paragraph 2 and, where relevant, 3 are fulfilled. 2. The following conditions shall be fulfilled by all contractual netting agreements used by an institution for the purposes of determining exposure value in this Part: (a) the institution has concluded a contractual netting agreement with its counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that, in the event of default by the counterparty it would be entitled to receive or obliged to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions; (b) the institution has made available to the competent auth­ orities written and reasoned legal opinions to the effect that, in the event of a legal challenge of the netting agreement, the institution's claims and obligations would not exceed those referred to in point (a). The legal opinion shall refer to the applicable law: (i) the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incor­ porated; (ii) if a branch of an undertaking is involved, which is located in a country other than that where the under­ taking is incorporated, the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (iii) the jurisdiction whose law governs the individual trans­ actions included in the netting agreement; (iv) the jurisdiction whose law governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting; (c) credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counter­ party. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes; (d) the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk away clause). If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk- reducing for either of the counterparties. Competent authorities shall inform each other accordingly. 3. The legal opinions referred to in point (b) may be drawn up by reference to types of contractual netting. The following additional conditions shall be fulfilled by contractual cross- product netting agreements: (a) the net sum referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 is the net sum of the positive and negative close out values of any included individual bilateral master agreement and of the positive and negative mark-to-market value of the individual transactions (the 'Cross-Product Net Amount'); EN L 176/186 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

For the purposes of this paragraph, the own funds requirement for investment undertakings of third coun­ tries, financial institutions, asset management companies and ancillary services undertakings is a notional own funds requirement. Article 16 Derogation to the application of the leverage ratio requirements on a consolidated basis for groups of investment firms Where all entities in a group of investment firms, including the parent entity, are investment firms that are exempt from the application of the requirements laid down in Part Seven on an individual basis in accordance with Article 6(5), the parent investment firm may choose not to apply the requirements laid down in Part Seven on a consolidated basis. Article 17 Supervision of investment firms waived from the application of own funds requirements on a consolidated basis 1. Investment firms in a group which has been granted the waiver provided for in Article 15 shall notify the competent authorities of the risks which could undermine their financial positions, including those associated with the composition and sources of their own funds, internal capital and funding. 2.

Paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article shall not apply where Part Six applies on the basis of an institution's consolidated situation. 2. However, the competent authorities may on a case-by-case basis permit proportional consolidation according to the share of capital that the parent undertaking holds in the subsidiary. Proportional consolidation may only be permitted where all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the liability of the parent undertaking is limited to the share of capital that the parent undertaking holds in the subsidiary in view of the liability of the other shareholders or members; (b) the solvency of those other shareholders or members is satisfactory; (c) the liability of the other shareholders and members is clearly established in a legally binding way. 3. Where undertakings are linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC, the competent authorities shall determine how consolidation is to be carried out. 4. The consolidating supervisor shall require the proportional consolidation according to the share of capital held of partici­ pations in institutions and financial institutions managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation, where those undertakings' liability is limited to the share of the capital they hold. 5. In the case of participations or capital ties other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the competent auth­ orities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out. In particular, they may permit or require use of the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.

(122) The primary purpose of the legal framework for credit institutions should be to ensure the operation of vital services to the real economy while limiting the risk of moral hazard. The structural separation of retail and investment banking activities within a banking group could be one of the key tools to support this objective. No provision in the current regulatory framework should therefore prevent the introduction of measures to effect such a separation. The Commission should be required to analyse the issue of structural separation in the Union and submit a report, together with legislative proposals, if appropriate, to the European Parliament and the Council. (123) Similarly, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability, Member States should also be permitted to adopt structural measures that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located. However, because such measures could have a negative impact by fragmenting the internal market, they should only be approved subject to strict conditions pending the entry into force of a future legal act explicitly harmonising such measures. (124) In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regu­ lation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of technical adjustments to this Regulation to clarify definitions to ensure uniform appli­ cation of this Regulation or to take account of devel­ opments on financial markets, to align terminology on, and frame definitions in accordance with, subsequent relevant acts, to adjust the provisions of this Regulation on own funds to reflect developments in accounting standards or Union law, or with regard to the convergence of supervisory practices, to expand the lists of exposure classes for the purposes of the Stan­ dardised Approach or the IRB Approach to take account of developments on financial markets, to adjust certain amounts relevant to those exposure classes to take into account the effects of inflation; to adjust the list and classification of off- balance sheet items and to adjust specific provisions and technical criteria on the treatment of counterparty credit risk, the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach, credit risk mitigation, securitisation, operational risk, market risk, liquidity, leverage and disclosure in order to take account of developments on financial markets or in accounting standards or Union law, or with regard to the convergence of supervisory practices and risk measurement and to take account of the outcome of the review of various matters relating to the scope of Directive 2004/39/EC. (125) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should also be delegated to the Commission in respect of prescribing a temporary reduction in the level of own funds or risk weights specified under this Regulation in order to take account of specific circum­ stances, to clarify the exemption of certain exposures from the application of provisions of this Regulation on large exposures, to specify amounts relevant to the calculation of capital requirements for the trading book to take account of developments in the economic and monetary field, to adjust the categories of investment firms eligible for certain derogations to required levels of own funds to take account of developments on financial markets, to clarify the requirement that investment firms hold own funds equivalent to one quarter of their fixed overheads of the preceding year to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, to determine the elements of own funds from which deductions of an institution's holdings of the instruments of relevant entities should be made, to introduce additional transitional provisions relating to the treatment of actuarial gains and losses in measuring defined benefit pension liabilities of institutions. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. (126) In accordance with Declaration No 39 on Article 290 TFEU, the Commission should continue to consult experts appointed by the Member States in the prep­ aration of draft delegated acts in the financial services area, in accordance with its established practice. (127) Technical standards in financial services should ensure harmonisation, uniform conditions and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union.

For institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under Chapter 3, the expected loss amount in respect of such exposures shall be zero. The requirements set out in the first subparagraph apply to the entire pool of exposures included in the securitisation. Subject to Article 250, the originator institution shall calculate risk- weighted exposure amounts in respect of all tranches in the securitisation in accordance with the provisions of this Section including those for which the institution recognises credit risk mitigation in accordance with Article 247, in which case the risk-weight to be applied to that position may be amended in accordance with Chapter 4, subject to the requirements laid down in this Chapter.

The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4; (b) an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for tranches appearing pursuant to this Section with a risk weighting of 1 250 %.

By contrast, a programme-wide credit enhancement covering only some of the losses above the seller-provided protection across the various pools generally would constitute a tranching of the risk of a pool of multiple assets containing at least one secu­ ritisation exposure, and would therefore be a re-securiti­ sation exposure. Nevertheless, if such a programme funds itself entirely with a single class of commercial paper, and if either the programme-wide credit enhancement is not a re-securitisation or the commercial paper is fully supported by the sponsoring institution, leaving the commercial paper investor effectively exposed to the default risk of the sponsor instead of the underlying pools or assets, then that commercial paper generally should not be considered a re-securitisation exposure. (65) The provisions on prudent valuation for the trading book should apply to all instruments measured at fair value, whether in the trading book or non- trading book of institutions. It should be clarified that, where the appli­ cation of prudent valuation would lead to a lower carrying value than actually recognised in the accounting, the absolute value of the difference should be deducted from own funds. (66) Institutions should have a choice whether to apply a capital requirement to or deduct from Common Equity Tier 1 items those securitisation positions that receive a 1 250 % risk weight under this Regulation, irrespective of whether the positions are in the trading or the non- trading book. (67) Originator or sponsor institutions should not be able to circumvent the prohibition of implicit support by using their trading books in order to provide such support. (68) Without prejudice to the disclosures explicitly required by this Regulation, the aim of the disclosure requirements should be to provide market participants with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the risk profile of individual institutions. Institutions should therefore be required to disclose additional information not explicitly listed in this Regulation where such disclosure is necessary to meet that aim. At the same time, competent authorities should pay appro­ priate attention to cases where they suspect that information is regarded as proprietary or confidential by an institution in order to avoid disclosure of such information. (69) Where an external credit assessment for a securitisation position incorporates the effect of credit protection provided by the investing institution itself, the institution should not be able to benefit from the lower risk weight resulting from that protection. The securitisation position should not be deducted from capital if there are other ways to determine a risk weight in line with the actual risk of the position which does not take that credit protection into account. (70) Given their recent weak performance, the standards for internal models to calculate market risk capital requirements should be strengthened. In particular, their capture of risks should be completed regarding credit risks in the trading book. Furthermore, capital charges should include a component adequate to stress conditions to strengthen capital requirements in view of deteriorating market conditions and in order to reduce the potential for pro-cyclicality. Institutions should also carry out reverse stress tests to examine what scenarios could challenge the viability of the insti­ tution unless they can prove that such a test is dispensable. Given the recent particular difficulties of treating securitisation positions using approaches based on internal models, the recognition of institutions' modelling of securitisation risks to calculate capital requirements in the trading book should be limited and a standardised capital charge for securitisation positions in the trading book should be required by default. (71) This Regulation lays down limited exceptions for certain correlation trading activities, in accordance with which an institution may be permitted by its supervisor to calculate a comprehensive risk capital charge subject to strict requirements. In such cases the institution should be required to subject those activities to a capital charge equal to the higher of the capital charge in accordance with that internally developed approach and 8 % of the capital charge for specific risk in accordance with the standardised measurement method. It should not be required to subject those exposures to the incremental risk charge but they should be incorporated into both the value-at-risk measures and the stressed value-at-risk measures. (72) In light of the nature and magnitude of unexpected losses experienced by institutions during the financial and economic crisis, it is necessary to improve further the quality and harmonisation of own funds that institutions are required to hold. This should include the introduction of a new definition of the core elements of capital available to absorb unexpected losses as they arise, enhancements to the definition of hybrid capital and uniform prudential adjustments to own funds. It is also necessary to raise significantly the level of own funds, including new capital ratios focusing on the core elements of own funds available to absorb losses as they arise.

Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following: (a) positions in contracts maturing on the same date; (b) positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates. 3. The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band.

That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position. 5. The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following: (a) the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity; (b) the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity; EN L 176/214 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013"

Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date.

A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table. 2. For the purposes of this Article, 'long position' means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and 'short position' means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future. Article 329 Options and warrants 1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.

Where an institution is either of the following, it shall include the commodities concerned in the calculation of its own funds requirement for commodities risk: (a) the transferor of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities in a repurchase agreement; (b) the lender of commodities in a commodities lending agreement. Article 359 Maturity ladder approach 1. The institution shall use a separate maturity ladder in line with Table 1 for each commodity. All positions in that commodity shall be assigned to the appropriate maturity bands. Physical stocks shall be assigned to the first maturity band between 0 and up to and including 1 month. Table 1 Maturity band (1) Spread rate (in %) (2) 0 ≤ 1 month 1,50 > 1 ≤ 3 months 1,50 > 3 ≤ 6 months 1,50 > 6 ≤ 12 months 1,50 > 1 ≤ 2 years 1,50 > 2 ≤ 3 years 1,50 > 3 years 1,50 2. Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following: (a) positions in contracts maturing on the same date; (b) positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates. 3. The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band. 4. That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position. 5. The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following: (a) the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity; (b) the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity; EN L 176/214 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Where daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years - occurring on equal and opposite positions in a pair of currencies over the following 10 working days show that these two currencies are perfectly positively correlated and the institution always can face a zero bid/ask spread on the respective trades, the institution can, upon explicit permission by its competent authority, apply an own funds requirement of 0 % until the end of 2017. CHAPTER 4 Own funds requirements for commodities risk Article 355 Choice of method for commodities risk Subject to Articles 356 to 358, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for commodities risk with one of the methods set out in Article 359, 360 or 361. Article 356 Ancillary commodities business 1. Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met: (a) at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year; (b) it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a); (c) its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5 % of its own funds or EUR 1 million and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6,5 % of its own funds; (d) the institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality. 2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1. Article 357 Positions in commodities 1. Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency. 2. Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated in accordance with Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calcu­ lating commodities risk. 3. For the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an insti­ tution's long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 358, as positions in the underlying commodity. 4. For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity: (a) positions in different sub-categories of commodities in cases where the sub-categories are deliverable against each other; (b) positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year. Article 358 Particular instruments 1. Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date. 2. Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 359(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.

Article 330 Swaps Swaps shall be treated for interest-rate risk purposes on the same basis as on-balance-sheet instruments. Thus, an interest- rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself. Article 331 Interest rate risk on derivative instruments 1. Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensi­ tivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments. 2. Institutions which do not use models under paragraph 1 may, treat as fully offsetting any positions in derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 which meet the following conditions at least: (a) the positions are of the same value and denominated in the same currency; (b) the reference rate (for floating-rate positions) or coupon (for fixed-rate positions) is closely matched; (c) the next interest-fixing date or, for fixed coupon positions, residual maturity corresponds with the following limits: (i) less than one month hence: same day; (ii) between one month and one year hence: within seven days; (iii) over one year hence: within 30 days. Article 332 Credit Derivatives 1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the 'protection seller'), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwith­ standing the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows: (a) a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation; (b) a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds; EN L 176/202 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institu­ tion's overall net foreign-exchange position. 5.

Article 353 Foreign exchange risk of CIUs 1. For the purposes of Article 352, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. 2. Institutions may rely on the following third parties' reporting of the foreign exchange positions in the CIU: (a) the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution; (b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3). The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor. 3. Where an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions in a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU is invested up to the maximum extent allowed under the CIU's mandate in foreign exchange and institutions shall, for trading book posi­ tions, take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the addition of the total long position to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position to the total short open foreign exchange position where the direction of the CIU's investment is available. There shall be no netting allowed between such positions prior to the calculation. Article 354 Closely correlated currencies 1. Institutions may provide lower own funds requirements against positions in relevant closely correlated currencies. A pair of currencies is deemed to be closely correlated only if the likelihood of a loss — calculated on the basis of daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years — occurring on equal and opposite positions in such currencies over the following 10 working days, which is 4 % or less of the value of the matched position in question (valued in terms of the reporting currency) has a probability of at least 99 %, when an observation period of three years is used, and 95 %, when an observation period of five years is used. The own-funds requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position. 2. In calculating the requirements of this Chapter, insti­ tutions may disregard positions in currencies, which are subject to a legally binding intergovernmental agreement to limit its variation relative to other currencies covered by the same agreement. Institutions shall calculate their matched positions in such currencies and subject them to an own funds requirement no lower than half of the maximum permissible variation laid down in the intergovernmental agreement in question in respect of the currencies concerned. 3.

Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions: (a) it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position; (b) institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate; (c) if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level. 4.

The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %. Article 352 Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position 1. The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative): (a) the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold); (b) the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position; (c) irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable; (d) the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options; (e) the market value of other options. The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying. The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently. The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force. 2. Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calcu­ lation of own funds.

Moreover, the Commission should aim to adopt the regulatory technical standards in good time to permit the European Parliament and the Council to exercise full scrutiny, taking account of the volume and complexity of regulatory technical standards and the details of the European Parliament's and the Council's rules of procedure, calendar of work and composition. (132) In order to ensure a high degree of transparency, EBA should launch consultations relating to the draft technical standards referred to in this Regulation. EBA and the Commission should start preparing their reports on liquidity requirements and leverage, as provided for in this Regulation, as soon as possible.

TITLE V OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTLEMENT RISK Article 378 Settlement/delivery risk In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase trans­ actions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed. The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution. The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appro­ priate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other non-trading book exposure, on the basis of the counter­ party's external rating. Institutions using own estimates of 'LGDs' may apply the LGD set out in Article 161(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures. If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.

The highest risk weight that would be applied under Chapter 2 to any of the securitised exposures, had they not been securitised, may be applied to the securitisation position represented by a liquidity facility that meets the conditions in Article 255(1). To determine the exposure value of the position a conversion factor of 100 % shall be applied. Article 264 Credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions subject to the IRB Approach 1. Where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Ratings Based Method, the exposure value or the risk-weight for a securitisation position in respect of which credit protection has been obtained may be amended in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2. 2. In the case of full credit protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, the following requirements shall apply: (a) the institution shall determine the 'effective risk weight' of the position. It shall do this by dividing the risk-weighted exposure amount of the position by the exposure value of the position and multiplying the result by 100; (b) in the case of funded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the funded protection-adjusted exposure amount of the position (E*), as calculated under Chapter 4 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the secu­ ritisation position to be E, by the effective risk weight; (c) in the case of unfunded credit protection, the risk-weighted exposure amount of the securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch and maturity mismatch (GA) in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 by the risk weight of the protection provider; and adding this to the amount arrived at by multiplying the amount of the securitisation position minus GA by the effective risk weight. 3. In the case of partial protection, where risk-weighted exposure amounts are calculated using the Supervisory Formula Method, the following requirements shall apply: (a) if the credit risk mitigation covers the first loss or losses on a proportional basis on the securitisation position, the insti­ tution may apply paragraph 2; (b) in other cases, the institution shall treat the securitisation position as two or more positions with the uncovered portion being considered the position with the lower credit quality. For the purposes of calculating the risk- weighted exposure amount for this position, the provisions in Article 262 shall apply subject to the adjustment of T to e* in the case of funded credit protection and to T-g in the case of unfunded credit protection, where e* denotes the ratio of E* to the total notional amount of the underlying pool, where E* is the adjusted exposure amount of the securitisation position calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 as they apply for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 taking the amount of the securitisation position to be E; and g is the ratio of the nominal amount of credit protection, adjusted for any currency or maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4, to the sum of the exposure amounts of the securitised exposures. In the case of unfunded credit protection the risk weight of the protection provider shall be applied to that portion of the position not falling within the adjusted value of T. 4. Where, in the case of unfunded credit protection, competent authorities have granted the institution permission to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Chapter 3, the risk weight g of exposures to the protection provider in accordance with Article 235 shall be determined as specified in Chapter 3. Article 265 Additional own funds requirements for securitisations of revolving exposures with early amortisation provisions 1. In addition to the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its securitisation positions, an originator institution shall calculate a risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with the methodology set out in Article 256 when it sells revolving exposures into a securitisation that contains an early amortisation provision. 2.

Where the possible reduction in risk weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by this securitisation is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authorities may decide on a case-by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered to have been transferred to third parties.

Where the protected amount (G A ) is less than the exposure (E), institutions may apply the formula specified in paragraph 1 only where the protected and unprotected parts of the exposure are of equal seniority. 3. Institutions may extend the treatment set out in Article 114(4) and (7) to exposures or parts of exposures guar­ anteed by the central government or central bank, where the guarantee is denominated in the domestic currency of the borrower and the exposure is funded in that currency. Article 236 Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach 1. For the covered portion of the exposure value (E), based on the adjusted value of the credit protection G A , the PD for the purposes of Section 4 of Chapter 3 may be the PD of the protection provider, or a PD between that of the borrower and that of the guarantor where a full substitution is deemed not to be warranted. In the case of subordinated exposures and non-subordinated unfunded protection, the LGD to be applied by institutions for the purposes of Section 4 of Chapter 3 may be that associated with senior claims.

When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts using internal models, institutions shall use the previous business day's model output. 7. The calculation of the potential change in value referred to in paragraph 6 shall be subject to all the following standards: (a) it shall be carried out at least daily; (b) it shall be based on a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval; (c) it shall be based on a 5-day equivalent liquidation period, except in the case of transactions other than securities repurchase transactions or securities lending or borrowing transactions where a 10-day equivalent liquidation period shall be used; (d) it shall be based on an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility; (e) the data set used in the calculation shall be updated every three months. Where an institution has a repurchase transaction, a securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction and margin lending or similar transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with Article 285(5). 8. For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions covered by master netting agreements, institutions shall use E* as calculated under paragraph 6 as the exposure value of the exposure to the counterparty arising from the transactions subject to the master netting agreement for the purposes of Article 113 under the Standardised Approach or Chapter 3 under the IRB Approach. 9. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following: (a) what constitutes an immaterial portfolio for the purpose of paragraph 3; (b) the criteria for determining whether an internal model is sound and implemented with integrity for the purpose of paragraphs 4 and 5 and master netting agreements.

The standards relating to internal data are the following: (a) an institution shall base its internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a three-year historical observation period; (b) an institution shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 317 and into the event types defined in Article 324, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In excep­ tional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line \"corporate items\". An institution shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. An institution shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that the institution has historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, provided that the institution is required to continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. An institution shall include oper­ ational risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk; (c) an institution's internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations. An insti­ tution shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. An institution shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection; (d) aside from information on gross loss amounts, an insti­ tution shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event; (e) an institution shall have in place specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from a loss event in a centralised function or an activity that spans more than one business line, as well as from related loss events over time; (f) an institution shall have in place documented procedures for assessing the on-going relevance of historical loss data, including those situations in which judgement overrides, scaling, or other adjustments may be used, to what extent they may be used and who is authorised to make such decisions. 4. The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following: (a) an institution's operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system; (b) an institution shall regularly review the conditions and practices for external data and shall document them and subject them to periodic independent review. 5. An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness. 6. The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following: (a) an institution's firm-wide risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile; (b) an institution shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas; (c) an institution shall be able to justify to competent auth­ orities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution's risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume; (d) an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, an institution shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.

The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification shall be sufficient to provide the institution with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates; (e) for purchased receivables the estimates shall reflect all relevant information available to the purchasing institution regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing institution, or by external sources. The purchasing institution shall evaluate any data relied upon which is provided by the seller; (f) an institution shall add to its estimates a margin of conser­ vatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. Where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism shall be larger. Where institutions use different estimates for the calculation of risk weights and for internal purposes, it shall be documented and be reasonable.

In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to PD estimation to exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3): (a) institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year default rates. PD estimates for obligors that are highly leveraged or for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets shall reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities; (b) for purchased corporate receivables institutions may estimate the EL by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year realised default rates; (c) if an institution derives long run average estimates of PDs and LGDs for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of EL, and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in Article 181(1)(a); (d) institutions shall use PD estimation techniques only with supporting analysis. Institutions shall recognise the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limi­ tations of techniques and information; (e) to the extent that an institution uses data on internal default experience for the estimation of PDs, the estimates shall be reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system.

This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers to be reasonable; (e) institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular in respect of the re- ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution. 3. For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay shall include the following: (a) the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status; (b) the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure; (c) the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit- related economic loss; (d) the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself; (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidi­ aries; (f) the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. 4.

The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation; (b) an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters.

CHAPTER 2 Basic indicator approach Article 315 Own funds requirement 1. Under the Basic Indicator Approach, the own funds requirement for operational risk is equal to 15 % of the average over three years of the relevant indicator as set out in Article 316. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the relevant indicator on the basis of the last three twelve-monthly observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates. 2. Where an institution has been in operation for less than three years it may use forward-looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as it is available. 3. Where an institution can prove to its competent authority that, due to a merger, an acquisition or a disposal of entities or activities, using a three year average to calculate the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit the institution to amend the calculation in a way that would take into account such events and shall duly inform EBA thereof. In such circumstances, the competent authority may, on its own initiative, also require an institution to amend the calculation. 4. Where for any given observation, the relevant indicator is negative or equal to zero, institutions shall not take into account this figure in the calculation of the average over three years. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years as the sum of positive figures divided by the number of positive figures. Article 316 Relevant indicator 1. For institutions applying accounting standards established by Directive 86/635/EEC, based on the accounting categories for the profit and loss account of institutions under Article 27 of that Directive, the relevant indicator is the sum of the elements listed in Table 1 of this paragraph. Institutions shall include each element in the sum with its positive or negative sign.

In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates: (a) institutions shall estimate conversion factors by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool using the default weighted average resulting from all observed defaults within the data sources; (b) institutions shall use conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised conversion factors at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn; (c) institutions' estimates of conversion factors shall reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default event is triggered. The conversion factor estimate shall incorporate a larger margin of conser­ vatism where a stronger positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of conversion factor; (d) in arriving at estimates of conversion factors institutions shall consider their specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. Institutions shall also consider their ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events; (e) institutions shall have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per obligor and per grade. The institution shall be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis; (f) if institutions use different estimates of conversion factors for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts and internal purposes it shall be documented and be reasonable. 2. For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data is relevant, this longer period shall be used. 3.

In those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions the property may instead be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the mortgage lending value. Institutions shall require the independent valuer not to take into account speculative elements in the assessment of the mortgage lending value and to document that value in a trans­ parent and clear manner. The value of the collateral shall be the market value or mortgage lending value reduced as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3) and to take account of any prior claims on the property. 2. For receivables, the value of receivables shall be the amount receivable. 3. Institutions shall value physical collateral other than immovable property at its market value. For the purposes of this Article, the market value is the estimated amount for which the property would exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length trans­ action. Article 230 Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for other eligible collateral under the IRB Approach 1. Institutions shall use LGD* calculated in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph 2 as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3. Where the ratio of the value of the collateral (C) to the exposure value (E) is below the required minimum collateralisation level of the exposure (C*) as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be the LGD laid down in Chapter 3 for uncollateralised exposures to the counterparty. For this purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor or percentage of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs. Where the ratio of the value of the collateral to the exposure value exceeds a second, higher threshold level of C** as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be that prescribed in Table 5. Where the required level of collateralisation C** is not achieved in respect of the exposure as a whole, institutions shall consider the exposure to be two exposures — one corresponding to the part in respect of which the required level of collateralisation C** is achieved and one corresponding to the remainder. 2. The applicable LGD* and required collateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures are set out in Table 5 of this paragraph.

    "question": "What is a 'netting set' according to the regulatory definition?",
    "reference_answer": "A netting set is a group of transactions between an institution and a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement recognized under Section 7 and Chapter 4. Transactions not subject to a recognized legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement are treated as their own netting set. Under the Internal Model Method, all netting sets with a single counterparty may be treated as a single netting set if negative simulated market values of individual netting sets are set to 0 in the estimation of expected exposure.",
    "generated_answer": "A netting set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a legally enforceable netting agreement. It typically includes transactions across various product categories such as repurchase transactions, securities lending/borrowing, margin lending, and derivative contracts, where mutual claims can be settled on a net basis in case of default.",

The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation; (b) an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters.

An institution may apply different approaches to different equity portfolios where the institution itself uses different approaches for internal risk management purposes. Where an institution uses different approaches, the choice of the PD / LGD approach or the internal models approach shall be made consistently, including over time and with the approach used for the internal risk management of the relevant equity exposure, and shall not be determined by regulatory arbitrage considerations. Institutions may treat equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings according to the treatment of other non credit- obligation assets. 2. Under the Simple risk weight approach, the risk weighted exposure amount shall be calculated according to the formula: Risk – weighted exposure amount ¼ RW ä exposure value, where: Risk weight (RW) = 190 % for private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios. Risk weight (RW) = 290 % for exchange traded equity exposures. Risk weight (RW) = 370 % for all other equity exposures. Short cash positions and derivative instruments held in the non- trading book are permitted to offset long positions in the same individual stocks provided that these instruments have been explicitly designated as hedges of specific equity exposures and that they provide a hedge for at least another year. Other short positions are to be treated as if they are long positions with the relevant risk weight assigned to the absolute value of each position. In the context of maturity mismatched positions, the method is that for corporate exposures as set out in Article 162(5). Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. 3. Under the PD/LGD approach, risk weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated according to the formulas in Article 153(1). If institutions do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights. At the individual exposure level the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the exposure value multiplied by 12,5. Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. This shall be subject to an LGD of 90 % on the exposure to the provider of the hedge. For private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios an LGD of 65 % may be used. For these purposes M shall be five years. EN L 176/100 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

        "content": "meet their capital requirements regarding the core elements of capital with such shares that meet a strict set of criteria for the core capital instruments and the disclosed reserves of the institution only. In order to adequately take into account the diversity of legal forms institutions within the Union are operating under, the strict set of criteria for the core capital instruments should ensure that core capital instruments for institutions whose shares are not admitted to trading on a regulated market are of the highest quality. This should not prevent institutions from paying, on shares that have differentiated or no voting rights, distributions that are a multiple of those paid on shares which have relatively higher levels of voting rights, provided that, irrespective of the level of voting rights, the strict criteria for Common Equity Tier 1 instruments are met, including those relating to the flexibility of payments, and provided that where a distribution is paid it is to be paid on all shares issued by the institution concerned. (73) Trade finance exposures are diverse in nature but share characteristics such as being small in value and short in duration and having an identifiable source of repayment. They are underpinned by movements of goods and services that support the real economy and in most cases help small companies in their day-to-day needs, thereby creating economic growth and job opportunities. Inflows and outflows are usually matched and liquidity risk is therefore limited. (74) It is appropriate that EBA keeps an up-to-date list of all of the forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. EBA should remove from that list non-State aid instruments issued after the date of entry into force of this Regulation not meeting the criteria specified in this Regulation and should publicly announce such removal. Where instruments removed by EBA from the list continue to be recognised after EBA's announcement, EBA should fully exercise its powers, in particular those conferred by Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 concerning breaches of Union law. It is recalled that a three-step mechanism applies for a proportionate response to instances of incorrect or insufficient appli­ cation of Union law, whereby, as a first step, EBA is empowered to investigate alleged incorrect or insufficient application of Union law obligations by national auth­ orities in their supervisory practice, concluded by a recommendation. Second, where the competent national authority does not follow the recommendation, the Commission is empowered to issue a formal opinion taking into account the EBA's recommendation, requiring the competent authority to take the actions necessary to ensure compliance with Union law. Third, to overcome exceptional situations of persistent inaction by the competent authority concerned, the EBA is empowered, as a last resort, to adopt decisions addressed to individual financial institutions. Moreover, it is recalled that, under Article 258 TFEU, where the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, it has the power to bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. (75) This Regulation should not affect the ability of competent authorities to maintain pre-approval processes regarding the contracts governing Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. In those cases such capital instruments should only be computed towards the institution's Additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital once they have successfully completed these approval processes. (76) For the purposes of strengthening market discipline and enhancing financial stability it is necessary to introduce more detailed requirements for disclosure of the form and nature of regulatory capital and prudential adjustments made in order to ensure that investors and depositors are sufficiently well informed about the solvency of institutions. (77) It is further necessary for competent authorities to have knowledge of the level, at least in aggregate terms, of repurchase agreements, securities lending and all forms of encumbrance of assets. Such information should be reported to the competent authorities. For the purposes of strengthening market discipline, there should be more detailed requirements for disclosure of repurchase agreements and secured funding. (78) The new definition of capital and regulatory capital requirements should be introduced in a manner that takes account of the fact that there are different national starting points and circumstances, with initial variance around the new standards reducing over the transition period. In order to ensure the appropriate continuity in the level of own funds, instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid rules and issued prior to the date of application of this Regulation will be grandfathered for the extent of the transition period. Reliance on State aid should be reduced as much as possible in the future. However, to the extent that State aid proves necessary in certain situations, this Regulation should provide for a framework to deal with such situations. In particular, this Regulation should specify what should be the treatment for own funds instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid rules. The possibility for institutions to benefit from such treatment should be subject to strict conditions. Furthermore, to the extent that such treatment allows for deviations from the new criteria on the quality of own funds instruments those deviations should be limited to the largest extent possible. The treatment for existing capital instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid- rules, should clearly distinguish between those capital instruments that comply with the requirements of this Regulation and those that do not. Appropriate transitional provisions for the latter case should therefore be laid down in this Regulation. EN L 176/10 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

For the purposes of the undertakings referred to in Article 153(3), the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider shall either be the LGD associated with an unhedged facility to the guarantor or the unhedged facility of the obligor, depending upon whether in the event both the guarantor and obligor default during the life of the hedged transaction, available evidence and the structure of the guarantee indicate that the amount recovered would depend on the financial condition of the guarantor or obligor, respectively. Article 162 Maturity 1. Institutions that have not received permission to use own LGDs and own conversion factors for exposures to corporates, institutions or central governments and central banks shall assign to exposures arising from repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions a maturity value (M) of 0,5 years and to all other exposures an M of 2,5 years. Alternatively, as part of the permission referred to in Article 143, the competent authorities shall decide on whether the institution shall use maturity (M) for each exposure as set out under paragraph 2. 2. Institutions that have received the permission of the competent authority to use own LGDs and own conversion factors for exposures to corporates, institutions or central governments and central banks pursuant to Article 143 shall calculate M for each of these exposures as set out in points (a) to (e) of this paragraph and subject to paragraphs 3 to 5 of this Article. M shall be no greater than five years except in the cases specified in Article 384(1) where M as specified there shall be used: (a) for an instrument subject to a cash flow schedule, M shall be calculated according to the following formula: M ¼ max ( 1,min (X t t · CF t X t CF t ,5 ) ) where CF t denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the obligor in period t; (b) for derivatives subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the exposure, where M shall be at least 1 year, and the notional amount of each exposure shall be used for weighting the maturity; (c) for exposures arising from fully or nearly-fully collateralised derivative instruments listed in Annex II and fully or nearly- fully collateralised margin lending transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least 10 days; (d) for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least five days. The notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity; (e) an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own PD estimates for purchased corporate receivables, for drawn amounts M shall equal the purchased receivables exposure weighted average maturity, where M shall be at least 90 days. This same value of M shall also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided the facility contains effective covenants, early amortisation triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing institution against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility's term. Absent such effective protections, M for undrawn amounts shall be calculated as the sum of the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement and the remaining maturity of the purchase facility, where M shall be at least 90 days; (f) for any other instrument than those mentioned in this paragraph or when an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in (a), M shall be the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, where M shall be at least 1 year; (g) for institutions using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6 to calculate the exposure values, M shall be calculated for exposures to which they apply this method and for which the maturity of the longest-dated contract contained in the netting set is greater than one year according to the following formula: M ¼ min X k EffectiveEE t k · Δt k · df t k · s t k þ X k EE t k · Δt k · df t k · ð1 – s t k Þ X k EffectiveEE t k · Δt k · df t k · s t k ,5 8 < : 9 = ; EN L 176/104 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Competent authorities shall grant this permission only if the institution uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for a limited number of smaller portfolios. For the purposes of a calculation under the preceding subparagraph and where the IMM model does not produce an expected exposure profile, an institution shall do both of the following: (a) assume a constant EE profile; (b) set EE equal to the exposure value as computed under the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6, or IMM for a maturity equal to the greater of: (i) half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set; (ii) the notional weighted average maturity of all trans­ actions inside the netting set. 5. An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 364(1) and Articles 365 and 367 as the sum of non-stressed and stressed Value- at-Risk, which shall be calculated as follows: (a) for the non-stressed Value-at-Risk, current parameter cali­ brations for expected exposure as set out in the first subparagraph of Article 292(2), shall be used; (b) for the stressed Value-at-Risk, future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in the second subparagraph of Article 292(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters shall be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-year stress period used for the exposure parameters; (c) the three-times multiplier used in the calculation of own funds requirements based on a Value-at-Risk and a stressed Value-at-Risk in accordance with 364(1) will apply to these calculations. EBA shall monitor for consistency any supervisory discretion used to apply a higher multiplier than that three-times multiplier to the Value-at-Risk and stressed Value-at-Risk inputs to the CVA charge. Competent authorities applying a multiplier higher than three shall provide a written justification to EBA; (d) the calculation shall be carried out on at least a monthly basis and the EE that is used shall be calculated on the same frequency. If lower than a daily frequency is used, for the purpose of the calculation specified in points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of Article 364(1) institutions shall take the average over three months. 6. For exposures to a counterparty, for which the institu­ tion's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments does not produce a proxy spread that is appropriate with respect to the criteria of rating, industry and region of the counterparty, the institution shall use the method set out in Article 384 to calculate the own funds requirement for CVA risk.

        "content": "(121) In order to take account of market developments and experience in the application of this Regulation, the Commission should be required to submit reports to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with legislative proposals, where appropriate, on the possible effect of capital requirements on the economic cycle of minimum, own funds requirements for exposures in the form of covered bonds, large exposures, liquidity requirements, leverage, exposures to transferred credit risk, counterparty credit risk and the original exposure method, retail exposures, on the definition of eligible capital, and the level of application of this Regu­ lation. (122) The primary purpose of the legal framework for credit institutions should be to ensure the operation of vital services to the real economy while limiting the risk of moral hazard. The structural separation of retail and investment banking activities within a banking group could be one of the key tools to support this objective. No provision in the current regulatory framework should therefore prevent the introduction of measures to effect such a separation. The Commission should be required to analyse the issue of structural separation in the Union and submit a report, together with legislative proposals, if appropriate, to the European Parliament and the Council. (123) Similarly, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability, Member States should also be permitted to adopt structural measures that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located. However, because such measures could have a negative impact by fragmenting the internal market, they should only be approved subject to strict conditions pending the entry into force of a future legal act explicitly harmonising such measures. (124) In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regu­ lation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of technical adjustments to this Regulation to clarify definitions to ensure uniform appli­ cation of this Regulation or to take account of devel­ opments on financial markets, to align terminology on, and frame definitions in accordance with, subsequent relevant acts, to adjust the provisions of this Regulation on own funds to reflect developments in accounting standards or Union law, or with regard to the convergence of supervisory practices, to expand the lists of exposure classes for the purposes of the Stan­ dardised Approach or the IRB Approach to take account of developments on financial markets, to adjust certain amounts relevant to those exposure classes to take into account the effects of inflation; to adjust the list and classification of off- balance sheet items and to adjust specific provisions and technical criteria on the treatment of counterparty credit risk, the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach, credit risk mitigation, securitisation, operational risk, market risk, liquidity, leverage and disclosure in order to take account of developments on financial markets or in accounting standards or Union law, or with regard to the convergence of supervisory practices and risk measurement and to take account of the outcome of the review of various matters relating to the scope of Directive 2004/39/EC. (125) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should also be delegated to the Commission in respect of prescribing a temporary reduction in the level of own funds or risk weights specified under this Regulation in order to take account of specific circum­ stances, to clarify the exemption of certain exposures from the application of provisions of this Regulation on large exposures, to specify amounts relevant to the calculation of capital requirements for the trading book to take account of developments in the economic and monetary field, to adjust the categories of investment firms eligible for certain derogations to required levels of own funds to take account of developments on financial markets, to clarify the requirement that investment firms hold own funds equivalent to one quarter of their fixed overheads of the preceding year to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, to determine the elements of own funds from which deductions of an institution's holdings of the instruments of relevant entities should be made, to introduce additional transitional provisions relating to the treatment of actuarial gains and losses in measuring defined benefit pension liabilities of institutions. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. (126) In accordance with Declaration No 39 on Article 290 TFEU, the Commission should continue to consult experts appointed by the Member States in the prep­ aration of draft delegated acts in the financial services area, in accordance with its established practice. (127) Technical standards in financial services should ensure harmonisation, uniform conditions and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union.

        "content": "(111) Pending the introduction of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) as a binding minimum standard, institutions should observe a general funding obligation. The general funding obligation should not be a ratio requirement. If, pending the introduction of the NSFR, a stable funding ratio is introduced as a minimum standard by way of a national provision, institutions should comply with this minimum standard accordingly. (112) Apart from short-term liquidity needs, institutions should also adopt funding structures that are stable over a longer term horizon. In December 2010, the BCBS agreed that the NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018 and that the BCBS will put in place rigorous reporting processes to monitor the ratio during a transition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial markets, credit extension and economic growth, addressing unintended consequences as necessary. The BCBS thus agreed that the NSFR will be subject to an observation period and will include a review clause. In that context, EBA should, based on reporting required by this Regulation, evaluate how a stable funding requirement should be designed. Based on this evaluation, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council together with any appropriate proposals in order to introduce such a requirement by 2018. (113) Weaknesses in corporate governance in a number of institutions have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the banking sector which led to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems. (114) In order to facilitate the monitoring of institutions' corporate governance practices and improve market discipline, institutions should publicly disclose their corporate governance arrangements. Their management bodies should approve and publicly disclose a statement providing assurance to the public that these arrangements are adequate and efficient. (115) In order to take account of the diversity of business models of institutions in the internal market certain long-term structural requirements such as the NSFR and the leverage ratio should be examined closely with a view of promoting a variety of sound banking structures which have been and should continue to of service to the Union's economy. (116) For the continuous provision of financial services to households and firms a stable funding structure is necessary. Long-term funding flows in bank-based financial systems in many Member States may generally possess different characteristics than those found in other international markets. In addition, specific funding structures may have developed in Member States to provide stable financing for long-term investment, including decentralised banking structures to channel liquidity or specialised mortgage securities which trade on highly liquid markets or are a welcome investment for long-term investors. Those structural factors should be carefully considered. It is essential to that purpose that, once international standards are finalised, EBA and the ESRB, based on reporting required by this Regulation, evaluate how a stable funding requirement should be designed fully taking into account the diversity of funding structures in the banking market in the Union. (117) In order to ensure progressive convergence between the level of own funds and the prudential adjustments applied to the definition of own funds across the Union and to the definition of own funds laid down in this Regulation during a transition period, the phasing in of the own funds requirements of this Regulation should occur gradually. It is vital to ensure that this phasing in is consistent with the recent enhancements made by Member States to the required levels of own funds and to the definition of own funds in place in the Member States. To that end, during the transition period the competent authorities should determine within defined lower and upper limits how rapidly to introduce the required level of own funds and prudential adjustments laid down in this Regulation. (118) In order to facilitate smooth transition from divergent prudential adjustments currently applied in Member States to the set of prudential adjustments laid down in this Regulation, competent authorities should be able during a transition period to continue to require institu­ tions, to a limited extent, to make prudential adjustments to own funds that are a derogation from this Regulation. (119) In order to ensure that institutions have sufficient time to meet the new required levels and definition of own funds, certain capital instruments that do not comply with the definition of own funds laid down in this Regu­ lation should be phased out between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2021. In addition, certain state-injected instruments should be recognised fully in own funds for a limited period. Furthermore, share premium accounts related to items that qualified as own funds under national transposition measures for Directive 2006/48/EC should under certain circumstances qualify as Common Equity Tier 1. (120) In order to ensure progressive convergence towards uniform rules on disclosure by institutions to provide market participants with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the risk profile of individual insti­ tutions, disclosure requirements should be phased in gradually.

The competent authorities may also apply the waiver if the financial holding companies holds a lower amount of own funds than the amount calculated under paragraph 1(d), but no lower than the sum of the own funds requirements imposed on an individual basis to investment firms, financial institutions, asset management companies and ancillary services under­ takings which would otherwise be consolidated and the total amount of any contingent liability in favour of investment firms, financial institutions, asset management companies and ancillary services undertakings which would otherwise be consolidated. For the purposes of this paragraph, the own funds requirement for investment undertakings of third coun­ tries, financial institutions, asset management companies and ancillary services undertakings is a notional own funds requirement. Article 16 Derogation to the application of the leverage ratio requirements on a consolidated basis for groups of investment firms Where all entities in a group of investment firms, including the parent entity, are investment firms that are exempt from the application of the requirements laid down in Part Seven on an individual basis in accordance with Article 6(5), the parent investment firm may choose not to apply the requirements laid down in Part Seven on a consolidated basis. Article 17 Supervision of investment firms waived from the application of own funds requirements on a consolidated basis 1. Investment firms in a group which has been granted the waiver provided for in Article 15 shall notify the competent authorities of the risks which could undermine their financial positions, including those associated with the composition and sources of their own funds, internal capital and funding. 2. Where the competent authorities responsible for the prudential supervision of the investment firm waive the obligation of supervision on a consolidated basis as provided for in Article 15, they shall take other appropriate measures to monitor the risks, notably large exposures, of the whole group, including any undertakings not located in a Member State. 3. Where the competent authorities responsible for the prudential supervision of the investment firm waive the appli­ cation of own funds requirements on a consolidated basis as provided for in Article 15, the requirements of Part Eight shall apply on an individual basis.

The institutions that are required to comply with the requirements referred to in Section 1 on the basis of their consolidated situation shall carry out a full consolidation of all institutions and financial institutions that are its subsidiaries or, where relevant, the subsidiaries of the same parent financial holding company or mixed parent financial holding company. Paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article shall not apply where Part Six applies on the basis of an institution's consolidated situation. 2. However, the competent authorities may on a case-by-case basis permit proportional consolidation according to the share of capital that the parent undertaking holds in the subsidiary. Proportional consolidation may only be permitted where all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the liability of the parent undertaking is limited to the share of capital that the parent undertaking holds in the subsidiary in view of the liability of the other shareholders or members; (b) the solvency of those other shareholders or members is satisfactory; (c) the liability of the other shareholders and members is clearly established in a legally binding way. 3. Where undertakings are linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC, the competent authorities shall determine how consolidation is to be carried out. 4. The consolidating supervisor shall require the proportional consolidation according to the share of capital held of partici­ pations in institutions and financial institutions managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation, where those undertakings' liability is limited to the share of the capital they hold. 5. In the case of participations or capital ties other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the competent auth­ orities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out. In particular, they may permit or require use of the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.

        "content": "the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions ( 1 ) have been significantly amended on several occasions. Many provisions of Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC are applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms. For the sake of clarity and in order to ensure a coherent application of those provisions, they should be merged into new legislative acts that are applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms, namely this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ). For greater accessibility, the provisions of the Annexes to Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC should be integrated into the enacting terms of Directive 2013/36/EU and this Regulation. (5) Together, this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU should form the legal framework governing the access to the activity, the supervisory framework and the prudential rules for credit institutions and investment firms (referred to collectively as \"institutions\"). This Regu­ lation should therefore be read together with that Directive (6) Directive 2013/36/EU, based on Article 53(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), should, inter alia, contain the provisions concerning the access to the activity of institutions, the modalities for their governance, and their supervisory framework, such as provisions governing the authori­ sation of the business, the acquisition of qualifying holdings, the exercise of the freedom of establishment and of the freedom to provide services, the powers of the competent authorities of the home and the host Member States in this regard and the provisions governing the initial capital and the supervisory review of institutions. (7) This Regulation should, inter alia, contain the prudential requirements for institutions that relate strictly to the functioning of banking and financial services markets and are meant to ensure the financial stability of the operators on those markets as well as a high level of protection of investors and depositors. This Regulation aims at contributing in a determined manner to the smooth functioning of the internal market and should, consequently, be based on the provisions of Article 114 TFEU, as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. (8) Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC, although having harmonised the rules of Member States in the area of prudential supervision to a certain degree, include a significant number of options and possibilities for Member States to impose stricter rules than those laid down by those Directives. This results in divergences between national rules, which might hamper the cross- border provision of services and the freedom of estab­ lishment and so create obstacles to the smooth func­ tioning of the internal market. (9) For reasons of legal certainty and because of the need for a level playing field within the Union, a single set of regulations for all market participants is a key element for the functioning of the internal market. In order to avoid market distortions and regulatory arbitrage, prudential minimum requirements should therefore ensure maximum harmonisation. As a consequence, the transitional periods provided for in this Regulation are essential for the smooth implementation of this Regu­ lation and to avoid uncertainty for the markets. (10) Having regard to work of the BCBS' Standards Imple­ mentation Group in monitoring and reviewing member countries' implementation of the Basel III framework, the Commission should provide update reports on an ongoing basis, and at least following the publication of each Progress Report by BCBS, on the implementation and domestic adoption of the Basel III framework in other major jurisdictions, including an assessment of the consistency of other countries' legislation or regu­ lations with the international minimum standards, in order to identify differences that could raise level playing field concerns. (11) In order to remove obstacles to trade and distortions of competition resulting from divergences between national laws and to prevent further likely obstacles to trade and significant distortions of competition from arising, it is therefore necessary to adopt a regulation establishing uniform rules applicable in all Member States. (12) Shaping prudential requirements in the form of a regu­ lation would ensure that those requirements will be directly applicable. This would ensure uniform conditions by preventing diverging national requirements as a result of the transposition of a directive. This Regulation would entail that all institutions follow the same rules in all the Union, which would also boost confidence in the stability of institutions, especially in times of stress. A regulation would also reduce regulatory complexity and firms' compliance costs, especially for institutions operating on a cross-border basis, and contribute to elim­ inating competitive distortions. With regard to the pecu­ liarity of immovable property markets which are char­ acterised by economic developments and jurisdictional differences that are specific to Member States, regions or local areas, competent authorities should be allowed to set higher risks weights or to apply stricter criteria based on default experience and expected market devel­ opments to exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property in specific areas.

        "content": "(79) Directive 2006/48/EC required credit institutions to provide own funds that are at least equal to specified minimum amounts until 31 December 2011. In the light of the continuing effects of the financial crisis in the banking sector and the extension of the transitional arrangements for capital requirements adopted by the BCBS, it is appropriate to reintroduce a lower limit for a limited period of time until sufficient amounts of own funds have been established in accordance with the tran­ sitional arrangements for own funds provided for in this Regulation that will be progressively phased in from the date of application of this Regulation to 2019. (80) For groups which include significant banking or investment business and insurance business, Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate ( 1 ), provides specific rules to address such 'double counting' of capital. Directive 2002/87/EC is based on inter­ nationally agreed principles for dealing with risk across sectors. This Regulation strengthens the way those financial conglomerates rules shall apply to bank and investment firm groups, ensuring their robust and consistent application. Any further changes that are necessary will be addressed in the review of Directive 2002/87/EC, which is expected in 2015. (81) The financial crisis highlighted that institutions greatly underestimated the level of counterparty credit risk associated with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. This prompted the G-20, in September 2009, to call for more OTC derivatives to be cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). Furthermore, they asked for those OTC derivatives that could not be cleared centrally to be subject to higher own funds requirements in order to properly reflect the higher risks associated with them. (82) Following the G-20 call, the BCBS, as part of the Basel III framework, materially changed the counterparty credit risk regime. The Basel III framework is expected to significantly increase the own fund requirements associated with institutions' OTC derivatives and securities financing transactions and to create important incentives for institutions to use CCPs. The Basel III framework is also expected to provide further incentives to strengthen the risk management of counterparty credit exposures and to revise the current regime for the treatment of counterparty credit risk exposures to CCPs. (83) Institutions should hold additional own funds due to credit valuation adjustment risk arising from OTC deriva­ tives. Institutions should also apply a higher asset value correlation in the calculation of the own fund requirements for counterparty credit risk exposures arising from OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions to certain financial institutions. Institutions should also be required to considerably improve measurement and management of counterparty credit risk by better addressing wrong-way risk, highly leveraged counterparties and collateral, accompanied by the corresponding enhancements in the areas of back- testing and stress testing. (84) Trade exposures to CCPs usually benefit from the multi­ lateral netting and loss-sharing mechanism provided by CCPs. As a consequence, they involve a very low counterparty credit risk and should therefore be subject to a very low own funds requirement. At the same time, this requirement should be positive in order to ensure that institutions track and monitor their exposures to CCPs as part of good risk management and to reflect that even trade exposures to CCPs are not risk-free. (85) A CCP's default fund is a mechanism that allows the sharing (mutualisation) of losses among the CCP's clearing members. It is used where the losses incurred by the CCP following the default of a clearing member are greater than the margins and default fund contributions provided by that clearing member and any other defence the CCP may use before recurring to the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members. In view of this, the risk of loss associated with exposures from default fund contributions is higher than that associated with trade exposures. Therefore, this type of exposures should be subject to a higher own funds requirement. (86) The \"hypothetical capital\" of a CCP should be a variable needed to determine the own funds requirement for a clearing member's exposures from its contributions to a CCP's default fund. It should not be understood as anything else. In particular, it should not be understood as the amount of capital that a CCP is required to hold by its competent authority. (87) The review of the treatment of counterparty credit risk, and in particular putting in place higher own funds requirements for bilateral derivative contracts in order to reflect the higher risk that such contracts pose to the financial system, forms an integral part of the Commission's efforts to ensure efficient, safe and sound derivatives markets. Consequently, this Regulation complements Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories ( 2 ).

EBA shall in the report referred to in paragraph 1 assess the following in particular: (a) the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its appli­ cation, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing; (b) the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2); (c) the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account inter­ national regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (d) the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State; (e) the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %; (f) the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons; (g) the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments; (h) derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject; (i) the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah- compliant banks; (j) the definition of circumstances of stress, including prin­ ciples for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance; (k) the definition of established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c); EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/287",

For the purposes of calculating own funds on an indi­ vidual basis, a sub-consolidated basis and a consolidated basis, where the competent authorities require or permit institutions to apply method 1, 2 or 3 of Annex I to Directive 2002/87/EC, the competent authorities may permit institutions not to deduct the holdings of own funds instruments of a financial sector entity in which the parent institution, parent financial holding company or parent mixed financial holding company or insti­ tution has a significant investment, provided that the conditions laid down in points (a) to (e) of this paragraph are met: (a) the financial sector entity is an insurance undertaking, a re- insurance undertaking or an insurance holding company; (b) that insurance undertaking, re-insurance undertaking or insurance holding company is included in the same supple­ mentary supervision under Directive 2002/87/EC as the parent institution, parent financial holding company or parent mixed financial holding company or institution that has the holding; (c) the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authorities; (d) prior to granting the permission referred to in point (c), and on a continuing basis, the competent authorities are satisfied that the level of integrated management, risk management and internal control regarding the entities that would be included in the scope of consolidation under method 1, 2 or 3 is adequate; (e) the holdings in the entity belong to one of the following: (i) the parent credit institution; (ii) the parent financial holding company; (iii) the parent mixed financial holding company; (iv) the institution; (v) a subsidiary of one of the entities referred to in points (i) to (iv) that is included in the scope of consolidation pursuant to Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One. The method chosen shall be applied in a consistent manner over time. 2. For the purposes of calculating own funds on an indi­ vidual basis and a sub-consolidated basis, institutions subject to supervision on a consolidated basis in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One shall not deduct holdings of own funds instruments issued by financial sector entities included in the scope of consolidated supervision, unless the competent authorities determine those deductions to be required for specific purposes, in particular structural separation of banking activities and resolution planning. Applying the approach referred to in the first subparagraph shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. 3. Competent authorities may, for the purposes of calcu­ lating own funds on an individual or sub-consolidated basis permit institutions not to deduct holdings of own funds instruments in the following cases: (a) where an institution has a holding in another institution and the conditions referred to in points (i) to (v) are met: (i) the institutions fall within the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7); (ii) the competent authorities have granted the permission referred to in Article 113(7); (iii) the conditions laid down in Article 113(7) are satisfied; (iv) the institutional protection scheme draws up a consolidated balance sheet referred to in point (e) of Article 113(7) or, where it is not required to draw up consolidated accounts, an extended aggregated calcu­ lation that is, to the satisfaction of the competent auth­ orities, equivalent to the provisions of Directive 86/635/EEC, which incorporates certain adaptations of the provisions of Directive 83/349/EEC or of Regu­ lation (EC) No 1606/2002, governing the consolidated accounts of groups of credit institutions. The equiv­ alence of that extended aggregated calculation shall be verified by an external auditor and in particular that the multiple use of elements eligible for the calculation of own funds as well as any inappropriate creation of own funds between the members of the institutional protection scheme is eliminated in the calculation.

In order to adequately take into account the diversity of legal forms institutions within the Union are operating under, the strict set of criteria for the core capital instruments should ensure that core capital instruments for institutions whose shares are not admitted to trading on a regulated market are of the highest quality. This should not prevent institutions from paying, on shares that have differentiated or no voting rights, distributions that are a multiple of those paid on shares which have relatively higher levels of voting rights, provided that, irrespective of the level of voting rights, the strict criteria for Common Equity Tier 1 instruments are met, including those relating to the flexibility of payments, and provided that where a distribution is paid it is to be paid on all shares issued by the institution concerned. (73) Trade finance exposures are diverse in nature but share characteristics such as being small in value and short in duration and having an identifiable source of repayment. They are underpinned by movements of goods and services that support the real economy and in most cases help small companies in their day-to-day needs, thereby creating economic growth and job opportunities. Inflows and outflows are usually matched and liquidity risk is therefore limited. (74) It is appropriate that EBA keeps an up-to-date list of all of the forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. EBA should remove from that list non-State aid instruments issued after the date of entry into force of this Regulation not meeting the criteria specified in this Regulation and should publicly announce such removal. Where instruments removed by EBA from the list continue to be recognised after EBA's announcement, EBA should fully exercise its powers, in particular those conferred by Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 concerning breaches of Union law. It is recalled that a three-step mechanism applies for a proportionate response to instances of incorrect or insufficient appli­ cation of Union law, whereby, as a first step, EBA is empowered to investigate alleged incorrect or insufficient application of Union law obligations by national auth­ orities in their supervisory practice, concluded by a recommendation. Second, where the competent national authority does not follow the recommendation, the Commission is empowered to issue a formal opinion taking into account the EBA's recommendation, requiring the competent authority to take the actions necessary to ensure compliance with Union law. Third, to overcome exceptional situations of persistent inaction by the competent authority concerned, the EBA is empowered, as a last resort, to adopt decisions addressed to individual financial institutions. Moreover, it is recalled that, under Article 258 TFEU, where the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, it has the power to bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. (75) This Regulation should not affect the ability of competent authorities to maintain pre-approval processes regarding the contracts governing Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. In those cases such capital instruments should only be computed towards the institution's Additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital once they have successfully completed these approval processes. (76) For the purposes of strengthening market discipline and enhancing financial stability it is necessary to introduce more detailed requirements for disclosure of the form and nature of regulatory capital and prudential adjustments made in order to ensure that investors and depositors are sufficiently well informed about the solvency of institutions. (77) It is further necessary for competent authorities to have knowledge of the level, at least in aggregate terms, of repurchase agreements, securities lending and all forms of encumbrance of assets. Such information should be reported to the competent authorities. For the purposes of strengthening market discipline, there should be more detailed requirements for disclosure of repurchase agreements and secured funding. (78) The new definition of capital and regulatory capital requirements should be introduced in a manner that takes account of the fact that there are different national starting points and circumstances, with initial variance around the new standards reducing over the transition period. In order to ensure the appropriate continuity in the level of own funds, instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid rules and issued prior to the date of application of this Regulation will be grandfathered for the extent of the transition period. Reliance on State aid should be reduced as much as possible in the future. However, to the extent that State aid proves necessary in certain situations, this Regulation should provide for a framework to deal with such situations. In particular, this Regulation should specify what should be the treatment for own funds instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid rules. The possibility for institutions to benefit from such treatment should be subject to strict conditions. Furthermore, to the extent that such treatment allows for deviations from the new criteria on the quality of own funds instruments those deviations should be limited to the largest extent possible. The treatment for existing capital instruments issued within the context of a recapitalisation measure pursuant to State aid- rules, should clearly distinguish between those capital instruments that comply with the requirements of this Regulation and those that do not. Appropriate transitional provisions for the latter case should therefore be laid down in this Regulation. EN L 176/10 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 420 Liquidity outflows 1. Pending the specification of a liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460, liquidity outflows to be reported shall include: (a) the current amount outstanding for retail deposits as set out in Article 421; (b) the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout by the issuing insti­ tutions or by the provider of the funding or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 422; (c) the additional outflows referred to in Article 423; (d) the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn committed credit and liquidity facil­ ities, as set out in Article 424; (e) the additional outflows identified in the assessment in accordance with paragraph 2. 2. Institutions shall regularly assess the likelihood and potential volume of liquidity outflows during the next 30 days as far as products or services are concerned, which are not captured in Articles 422, 423 and 424 and which they offer or sponsor or which potential purchasers would consider to be associated with them, including but not limited to liquidity outflows resulting from any contractual arrangements such as other off-balance sheet and contingent funding obligations, including, but not limited to committed funding facilities, un-drawn loans and advances to wholesale counterparties, mortgages that have been agreed but not yet drawn down, credit cards, overdrafts, planned outflows related to renewal or extension of new retail or wholesale loans, planned derivative payables and trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and in Annex I. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario. For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Insti­ tutions shall report not less than annually to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in the first subparagraph are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I. The competent authorities shall at least annually report to EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from institu­ tions. They shall in that report also explain the methodology applied to determine the outflows. Article 421 Outflows on retail deposits 1. Institutions shall separately report the amount of retail deposits covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country, and multiply by at least 5 % where the deposit is either of the following: (a) part of an established relationship making withdrawal highly unlikely; (b) held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited. 2. Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10 %. 3. Taking into account the behaviour of local depositors as advised by competent authorities, EBA shall issue guidelines by 1 January 2014 on the criteria to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identifi­ cation of retail deposits subject to different outflows and the definitions of those products for purposes of this Title. Those guidelines shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario. 4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in those paragraphs if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.

By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall, after consulting EBA and ESMA and in the light of discussions with the competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms and of firms referred to in points (2)(b) and (c) of Article 4(1). Where appro­ priate the report shall be followed by a legislative proposal. Article 509 Liquidity requirements 1. EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 415(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, non-financial end-users, the banking industry, competent authorities and the ESCB central banks annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission on whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Part Six based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall take due account of markets and international regulatory developments as well as of the interactions of the liquidity coverage requirement with other prudential requirements under this Regulation such as the risk based capital ratios as set out in Article 92 and the leverage ratio. The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on the report referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. EBA shall in the report referred to in paragraph 1 assess the following in particular: (a) the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its appli­ cation, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing; (b) the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2); (c) the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account inter­ national regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (d) the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State; (e) the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %; (f) the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons; (g) the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments; (h) derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject; (i) the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah- compliant banks; (j) the definition of circumstances of stress, including prin­ ciples for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance; (k) the definition of established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c); EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/287",

By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those para­ graphs. By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another insti­ tution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed. Article 425 Inflows 1. Institutions shall report their liquidity inflows. Capped liquidity inflows shall be the liquidity inflows limited to 75 % of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions and qualifying for the treatments set out in Article 113(6) or (7) from this limit. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from monies due from borrowers and bond investors related to mortgage lending funded by bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) or (6) or by bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC from this limit. Insti­ tutions may exempt inflows from promotional loans that the institutions have passed through. Subject to the prior approval of the competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis, the institution may fully or partially exempt inflows where the provider is a parent or a subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC. 2. The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the institution has no reason to expect non-performance within the 30-day time horizon. Liquidity inflows shall be reported in full with the following inflows reported separately: (a) monies due from customers that are not financial customers for the purposes of principal payment shall be reduced by 50 % of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 as referred to in point (d) of this paragraph. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point, institutions that have received a commitment referred to in Article 424(6) in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans; (b) monies due from trade financing transactions referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 162(3) with a residual maturity of up to 30 days, shall be taken into account in full as inflows; (c) assets with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow provided that the contract allows the bank to withdraw and request payment within 30 days; (d) monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due; (e) monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow; (f) monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided there is no double counting with liquid assets; (g) any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account. 3. Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416. 4. By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider; EN L 176/250 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Collateral other than assets referred to in Article 416(1)(a), (b) and (c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 20 %. 2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities all contracts entered into the contractual conditions of which lead, within 30 days following a material deterioration of the credit quality of the institution, to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs. If the competent authorities consider such contracts material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the insti­ tution to add an additional outflow for those contracts corresponding to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in the credit quality of the institution such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities. 3. The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the institution's derivatives transactions, financing transactions and other contracts if material. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the conditions of application in relation to the notion of materiality and methods for the measurement of this additional outflow.

EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines. 4. Credit risk mitigation on securitisation positions may be recognised in accordance with Article 264(2) to (4), subject to the conditions in Article 247. Article 263 Liquidity Facilities 1. For the purposes of determining the exposure value of an unrated securitisation position in the form of cash advance facilities, a conversion factor of 0 % may be applied to the nominal amount of a liquidity facility that meets the conditions set out in Article 255(2). 2. When it is not possible for the institution to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for the securitised exposures as if they had not been securitised, an institution may, on an exceptional basis and subject to the permission of the competent authorities, temporarily apply the method set out in paragraph 3 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for an unrated securitisation position in the form of liquidity facility that meets the conditions in Article 255(1). Institutions shall notify the use they make of the first sentence to the competent authorities, together with its reasons and the intended time period of use. The calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts shall, in general, be deemed not to be possible if an inferred rating, the Internal Assessment Approach and the Supervisory Formula Approach are not at the institution's disposal.

Unless noted otherwise, the exposure value of on-balance sheet exposures shall be the accounting value measured without taking into account any credit risk adjustments made. This rule also applies to assets purchased at a price different than the amount owed. For purchased assets, the difference between the amount owed and the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments have been applied that has been recorded on the balance-sheet of the institutions when purchasing the asset is denoted discount if the amount owed is larger, and premium if it is smaller. 2. Where institutions use Master netting agreements in relation to repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 4 or 6. 3. In order to calculate the exposure value for on-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits, institutions shall apply the methods set out in Chapter 4. 4. The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments shall comprise the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option (i.e. option the exercise of which is reasonably certain). If a party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased asset and this payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligi­ bility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Article 213, the payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4. 5. In the case of any contract listed in Annex II, the exposure value shall be determined by the methods set out in Chapter 6 and shall not take into account any credit risk adjustment made. 6. The exposure value for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts of purchased receivables shall be the value determined in accordance with paragraph 1 minus the own funds requirements for dilution risk prior to credit risk miti­ gation. 7. Where an exposure takes the form of securities or commodities sold, posted or lent under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions, the exposure value shall be the value of the securities or commodities determined in accordance with Article 24. Where the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method as set out under Article 223 is used, the exposure value shall be increased by the volatility adjustment appropriate to such securities or commodities, as set out therein. The exposure value of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions may be determined either in accordance with Chapter 6 or Article 220(2). 8. The exposure value for the following items shall be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a conversion factor. Institutions shall use the following conversion factors in accordance with Article 151(8) for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks: (a) for credit lines that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the institution without prior notice, or that effec­ tively provide for automatic cancellation due to deterio­ ration in a borrower's credit worthiness, a conversion factor of 0 % shall apply. To apply a conversion factor of 0 %, institutions shall actively monitor the financial condition of the obligor, and their internal control systems shall enable them to immediately detect deterio­ ration in the credit quality of the obligor. Undrawn credit lines may be considered as unconditionally cancellable if the terms permit the institution to cancel them to the full extent allowable under consumer protection and related legislation; (b) for short-term letters of credit arising from the movement of goods, a conversion factor of 20 % shall apply for both the issuing and confirming institutions; (c) for undrawn purchase commitments for revolving purchased receivables that are able to be unconditionally cancelled or that effectively provide for automatic cancel­ lation at any time by the institution without prior notice, a conversion factor of 0 % shall apply.

Article 511 Leverage 1. Based on the results of the report referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission shall submit by 31 December 2016 a report on the impact and effectiveness of the leverage ratio to the European Parliament and the Council. 2. Where appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal on the introduction of an appropriate number of levels of the leverage ratio that institutions following different business models would be required to meet, suggesting an adequate calibration for those levels and any appropriate adjustments to the capital measure and the total exposure measure as referred to in Article 429, together with any connected flexibility measures if necessary, including appropriate amendments to Article 458 to introduce the leverage ratio within the scope of measures included in that Article. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 October 2016 on at least the following: (a) whether the leverage ratio framework provided by this Regulation and Articles 87 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU is the appropriate tool to suppress the risk of excessive leverage on the part of the institutions in a satisfactory manner and degree; (b) on identifying business models that reflect the overall risk profiles of the institutions and on introducing differentiated levels of the leverage ratio for those business models; (c) whether the requirements laid out in Articles 76 and 87 of Directive 2013/36/EU in accordance with Articles 73 and 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU for addressing the risk of excessive leverage are sufficient to ensure sound management of this risk by institutions and, if not, which further enhancements are needed in order to ensure these objectives; (d) whether – and if so, which - changes to the calculation methodology referred to in Article 429 would be necessary to ensure that the leverage ratio can be used as an appropriate indicator of an institution's risk of excessive leverage; (e) whether, in the context of the calculation of the total exposure measure of the leverage ratio, the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II determined by using the Original Exposure Method differs in a material way from the exposure value determined by using the Mark-to-Market Method; (f) whether using either own funds or Common Equity Tier 1 capital as the capital measure of the leverage ratio could be more appropriate for the intended purpose of tracking the risk of excessive leverage and, if so, what would be the appropriate calibration of the leverage ratio; (g) whether the conversion factor referred to in point (a) of Article 429(10) for undrawn credit facilities, which may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice, is appropriately conservative based on the evidence collected during the observation period; (h) whether the frequency and format of the disclosure of items referred to in Article 451 are adequate; (i) what would be the appropriate level for the leverage ratio for each of the business models indentified in accordance with point (b); (j) whether a range for each level of the leverage ratio should be defined; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/289",

EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1). The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4.

By 31 January 2014, EBA shall furthermore report on the following: (a) uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality; (b) the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which: (i) a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise insti­ tutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations; (ii) regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation; (iii) the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments; (c) the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments. Article 510 Net Stable Funding Requirements 1. By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending. In particular EBA shall analyse the impact of stable sources of funding on the refinancing structures of different banking models in the Union.

Article 320 Criteria for the Standardised Approach The criteria referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 312(1) are the following: (a) an institution shall have in place a well-documented assessment and management system for operational risk with clear responsibilities assigned for this system. It shall identify its exposures to operational risk and track relevant operational risk data, including material loss data. This system shall be subject to regular independent review carried out by an internal or external party possessing the necessary knowledge to carry out such review; (b) an institution's operational risk assessment system shall be closely integrated into the risk management processes of the institution. Its output shall be an integral part of the process of monitoring and controlling the institution's operational risk profile; (c) an institution shall implement a system of reporting to senior management that provides operational risk reports to relevant functions within the institution. An institution shall have in place procedures for taking appropriate action according to the information within the reports to management. CHAPTER 4 Advanced measurement approaches Article 321 Qualitative standards The qualitative standards referred to in Article 312(2) are the following: (a) an institution's internal operational risk measurement system shall be closely integrated into its day-to-day risk management processes; (b) an institution shall have an independent risk management function for operational risk; (c) an institution shall have in place regular reporting of oper­ ational risk exposures and loss experience and shall have in place procedures for taking appropriate corrective action; (d) an institution's risk management system shall be well docu­ mented. An institution shall have in place routines for ensuring compliance and policies for the treatment of non-compliance; (e) an institution shall subject its operational risk management processes and measurement systems to regular reviews performed by internal or external auditors; (f) an institution's internal validation processes shall operate in a sound and effective manner; (g) data flows and processes associated with an institution's risk measurement system shall be transparent and accessible. Article 322 Quantitative Standards 1. The quantitative standards referred to in Article 312(2) include the standards relating to process, to internal data, to external data, to scenario analysis, to business environment and to internal control factors laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 respectively. 2. The standards relating to process are the following: (a) an institution shall calculate its own funds requirement as comprising both expected loss and unexpected loss, unless expected loss is adequately captured in its internal business practices. The operational risk measure shall capture poten­ tially severe tail events, achieving a soundness standard comparable to a 99,9 % confidence interval over a one year period; (b) an institution's operational risk measurement system shall include the use of internal data, external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business environment and internal control systems as set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. An institution shall have in place a well documented approach for weighting the use of these four elements in its overall operational risk measurement system; (c) an institution's risk measurement system shall capture the major drivers of risk affecting the shape of the tail of the estimated distribution of losses; (d) an institution may recognise correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk estimates only where its systems for measuring correlations are sound, implemented with integrity, and take into account the uncertainty surrounding any such correlation estimates, particularly in periods of stress. An institution shall validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques; (e) an institution's risk measurement system shall be internally consistent and shall avoid the multiple counting of quali­ tative assessments or risk mitigation techniques recognised in other areas of this Regulation.

Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements: (a) the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off- balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves; (b) the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an insti­ tution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3); (c) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions; (d) the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant posi­ tions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions; (e) the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scen­ arios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or port­ folio. 3. Institutions may, in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories only if the institution's approach for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity. Article 368 Qualitative requirements 1. Any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, all of the following qualitative requirements shall be met: (a) any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management; (b) the institution shall have a risk control unit that is inde­ pendent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management. The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, being responsible for the overall risk management system. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits; (c) the institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution's overall risk exposure; (d) the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading, risk- control, audit and back-office areas; EN L 176/218 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

The standards relating to internal data are the following: (a) an institution shall base its internally generated operational risk measures on a minimum historical observation period of five years. When an institution first moves to an Advanced Measurement Approach, it may use a three-year historical observation period; (b) an institution shall be able to map their historical internal loss data into the business lines defined in Article 317 and into the event types defined in Article 324, and to provide these data to competent authorities upon request. In excep­ tional circumstances, an institution may allocate loss events which affect the entire institution to an additional business line \"corporate items\". An institution shall have in place documented, objective criteria for allocating losses to the specified business lines and event types. An institution shall record the operational risk losses that are related to credit risk and that the institution has historically included in the internal credit risk databases in the operational risk databases and shall identify them separately. Such losses shall not be subject to the operational risk charge, provided that the institution is required to continue to treat them as credit risk for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements. An institution shall include oper­ ational risk losses that are related to market risks in the scope of the own funds requirement for operational risk; (c) an institution's internal loss data shall be comprehensive in that it captures all material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations. An insti­ tution shall be able to justify that any excluded activities or exposures, both individually and in combination, would not have a material impact on the overall risk estimates. An institution shall define appropriate minimum loss thresholds for internal loss data collection; (d) aside from information on gross loss amounts, an insti­ tution shall collect information about the date of the loss event, any recoveries of gross loss amounts, as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss event; (e) an institution shall have in place specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from a loss event in a centralised function or an activity that spans more than one business line, as well as from related loss events over time; (f) an institution shall have in place documented procedures for assessing the on-going relevance of historical loss data, including those situations in which judgement overrides, scaling, or other adjustments may be used, to what extent they may be used and who is authorised to make such decisions. 4. The qualifying standards relating to external data are the following: (a) an institution's operational risk measurement system shall use relevant external data, especially when there is reason to believe that the institution is exposed to infrequent, yet potentially severe, losses. An institution shall have a systematic process for determining the situations for which external data shall be used and the methodologies used to incorporate the data in its measurement system; (b) an institution shall regularly review the conditions and practices for external data and shall document them and subject them to periodic independent review. 5. An institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to high severity events. Over time, the institution shall validate and reassess such assessments through comparison to actual loss experience to ensure their reasonableness. 6. The qualifying standards relating to business environment and internal control factors are the following: (a) an institution's firm-wide risk assessment methodology shall capture key business environment and internal control factors that can change the institutions operational risk profile; (b) an institution shall justify the choice of each factor as a meaningful driver of risk, based on experience and involving the expert judgment of the affected business areas; (c) an institution shall be able to justify to competent auth­ orities the sensitivity of risk estimates to changes in the factors and the relative weighting of the various factors. In addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls, an institution's risk measurement framework shall also capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased business volume; (d) an institution shall document its risk measurement framework and shall subject it to independent review within the institution and by competent authorities. Over time, an institution shall validate and reassess the process and the outcomes through comparison to actual internal loss experience and relevant external data.

The competent authorities shall permit institutions to recognise the impact of insurance subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 and other risk transfer mechanisms where the institution can demonstrate that a noticeable risk mitigating effect is achieved. 2. The insurance provider shall be authorised to provide insurance or re-insurance and shall have a minimum claims paying ability rating by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to insti­ tutions under Title II, Chapter 2. 3. The insurance and the institutions' insurance framework shall meet all the following conditions: (a) the insurance policy has an initial term of no less than one year. For policies with a residual term of less than one year, an institution shall make appropriate haircuts reflecting the declining residual term of the policy, up to a full 100 % haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less; (b) the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of the contract of 90 days; (c) the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by supervisory actions or, in the case of a failed institution, that preclude the institution's receiver or liquidator from recovering the damages suffered or expenses incurred by the institution, except in respect of events occurring after the initiation of receivership or liqui­ dation proceedings in respect of the institution. However, the insurance policy may exclude any fine, penalty, or punitive damages resulting from actions by the competent authorities; (d) the risk mitigation calculations shall reflect the insurance coverage in a manner that is transparent in its relationship to, and consistent with, the actual likelihood and impact of loss used in the overall determination of operational risk capital; (e) the insurance is provided by a third party entity. In the case of insurance through captives and affiliates, the exposure has to be laid off to an independent third party entity that meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraph 2; (f) the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented. 4. The methodology for recognising insurance shall capture all the following elements through discounts or haircuts in the amount of insurance recognition: (a) the residual term of the insurance policy, where less than one year; (b) the policy's cancellation terms, where less than one year; (c) the uncertainty of payment as well as mismatches in coverage of insurance policies. 5. The reduction in own funds requirements from the recog­ nition of insurances and other risk transfer mechanisms shall not exceed 20 % of the own funds requirement for operational risk before the recognition of risk mitigation techniques.

For institutions that want to use an Advanced Measurement Approach in combination with either the Basic Indicator Approach or the Standardised Approach competent authorities shall impose the following additional conditions for granting permission: (a) on the date of implementation of an Advanced Measurement Approach, a significant part of the institu­ tion's operational risks are captured by that Approach; (b) the institution takes a commitment to apply the Advanced Measurement Approach across a material part of its oper­ ations within a time schedule that was submitted to and approved by its competent authorities. 4. An institution may request permission from a competent authority to use a combination of the Basic Indicator Approach and the Standardised Approach only in exceptional circum­ stances such as the recent acquisition of new business which may require a transition period for the application of the Stan­ dardised Approach. A competent authority shall grant such permission only where the institution has committed to apply the Standardised Approach within a time schedule that was submitted to and approved by the competent authority. 5. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following: (a) the conditions that competent authorities shall use when assessing the methodology referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2; (b) the conditions that the competent authorities shall use when deciding whether to impose the additional conditions referred to in paragraph 3. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2016. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. CHAPTER 2 Basic indicator approach Article 315 Own funds requirement 1. Under the Basic Indicator Approach, the own funds requirement for operational risk is equal to 15 % of the average over three years of the relevant indicator as set out in Article 316. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the relevant indicator on the basis of the last three twelve-monthly observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates. 2. Where an institution has been in operation for less than three years it may use forward-looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as it is available. 3. Where an institution can prove to its competent authority that, due to a merger, an acquisition or a disposal of entities or activities, using a three year average to calculate the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit the institution to amend the calculation in a way that would take into account such events and shall duly inform EBA thereof. In such circumstances, the competent authority may, on its own initiative, also require an institution to amend the calculation. 4. Where for any given observation, the relevant indicator is negative or equal to zero, institutions shall not take into account this figure in the calculation of the average over three years. Institutions shall calculate the average over three years as the sum of positive figures divided by the number of positive figures. Article 316 Relevant indicator 1. For institutions applying accounting standards established by Directive 86/635/EEC, based on the accounting categories for the profit and loss account of institutions under Article 27 of that Directive, the relevant indicator is the sum of the elements listed in Table 1 of this paragraph. Institutions shall include each element in the sum with its positive or negative sign.

The position shall be attributed a derived rating the same as the credit assessments corresponding to that rating grade as laid down in point (e) of paragraph 3. Where this derived rating is, at the inception of the securitisation, at the level of investment grade or better, it shall be considered the same as an eligible credit assessment by an ECAI for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts. 5. Institutions which have obtained permission to use the Internal Assessment Approach shall not revert to the use of other methods unless all of the following conditions are met: (a) the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the institution has good cause to do so; (b) the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority. Article 260 Maximum risk-weighted exposure amounts An originator institution, a sponsor institution, or other insti­ tutions which can calculate KIRB may limit the risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated in respect of its positions in a securitisation to that which would produce a own funds requirement under Article 92(3) equal to the sum of 8 % of the risk-weighted exposure amounts which would be produced if the securitised assets had not been securitised and were on the balance sheet of the institution plus the expected loss amounts of those exposures. Article 261 Ratings Based Method 1. Under the Ratings Based Method, the institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a rated securiti­ sation or re-securitisation position by applying the relevant risk weight to the exposure value and multiplying the result by 1,06. The relevant risk weight shall be the risk weight as laid down in Table 4, with which the credit assessment of the position is associated in accordance with Section 4.

For the remainder of the securitisation positions that are not re- securitisation positions, the weightings in column B shall be applied unless the position is in the most senior tranche of a securitisation, in which case the weightings in column A shall be applied. For re-securitisation positions the weightings in column E shall be applied unless the re-securitisation position is in the most senior tranche of the re-securitisation and none of the underlying exposures are themselves re-securitisation exposures, in which case column D shall be applied. When determining whether a tranche is the most senior, it is not required to take into consideration amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments. In calculating the effective number of exposures securitised multiple exposures to one obligor shall be treated as one exposure. The effective number of exposures is calculated as: N ¼ 8 > > : X i EAD i 9 > > ; 2 X i EAD 2 i where EAD i represents the sum of the exposure values of all exposures to the i th obligor. If the portfolio share associated with the largest exposure, C 1 , is available, the institution may compute N as 1/C 1 . EN L 176/162 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4. The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall consider whether, and if, to what extent standby credit facilities referred to in point (e) of Article 416(1) should be included as liquid assets in light of international development and taking into account European specificities, including the way monetary policy is performed in the Union. EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions: (a) minimum trade volume of the assets; (b) minimum outstanding volume of the assets; (c) transparent pricing and post-trade information; (d) credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) proven record of price stability; (f) average volume traded and average trade size; (g) maximum bid/ask spread; (h) remaining time to maturity; (i) minimum turnover ratio. 5.

By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall, after consulting EBA and ESMA and in the light of discussions with the competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms and of firms referred to in points (2)(b) and (c) of Article 4(1). Where appro­ priate the report shall be followed by a legislative proposal. Article 509 Liquidity requirements 1. EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 415(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, non-financial end-users, the banking industry, competent authorities and the ESCB central banks annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission on whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Part Six based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall take due account of markets and international regulatory developments as well as of the interactions of the liquidity coverage requirement with other prudential requirements under this Regulation such as the risk based capital ratios as set out in Article 92 and the leverage ratio. The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on the report referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. EBA shall in the report referred to in paragraph 1 assess the following in particular: (a) the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its appli­ cation, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing; (b) the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2); (c) the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account inter­ national regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (d) the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State; (e) the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %; (f) the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons; (g) the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments; (h) derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject; (i) the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah- compliant banks; (j) the definition of circumstances of stress, including prin­ ciples for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance; (k) the definition of established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c); EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/287",

By 31 December 2016, the Commission shall, if appro­ priate, and taking into account the reports referred to in para­ graphs 1 and 2, and taking full account of the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council on how to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding. Article 511 Leverage 1. Based on the results of the report referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission shall submit by 31 December 2016 a report on the impact and effectiveness of the leverage ratio to the European Parliament and the Council. 2. Where appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal on the introduction of an appropriate number of levels of the leverage ratio that institutions following different business models would be required to meet, suggesting an adequate calibration for those levels and any appropriate adjustments to the capital measure and the total exposure measure as referred to in Article 429, together with any connected flexibility measures if necessary, including appropriate amendments to Article 458 to introduce the leverage ratio within the scope of measures included in that Article. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 October 2016 on at least the following: (a) whether the leverage ratio framework provided by this Regulation and Articles 87 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU is the appropriate tool to suppress the risk of excessive leverage on the part of the institutions in a satisfactory manner and degree; (b) on identifying business models that reflect the overall risk profiles of the institutions and on introducing differentiated levels of the leverage ratio for those business models; (c) whether the requirements laid out in Articles 76 and 87 of Directive 2013/36/EU in accordance with Articles 73 and 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU for addressing the risk of excessive leverage are sufficient to ensure sound management of this risk by institutions and, if not, which further enhancements are needed in order to ensure these objectives; (d) whether – and if so, which - changes to the calculation methodology referred to in Article 429 would be necessary to ensure that the leverage ratio can be used as an appropriate indicator of an institution's risk of excessive leverage; (e) whether, in the context of the calculation of the total exposure measure of the leverage ratio, the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II determined by using the Original Exposure Method differs in a material way from the exposure value determined by using the Mark-to-Market Method; (f) whether using either own funds or Common Equity Tier 1 capital as the capital measure of the leverage ratio could be more appropriate for the intended purpose of tracking the risk of excessive leverage and, if so, what would be the appropriate calibration of the leverage ratio; (g) whether the conversion factor referred to in point (a) of Article 429(10) for undrawn credit facilities, which may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice, is appropriately conservative based on the evidence collected during the observation period; (h) whether the frequency and format of the disclosure of items referred to in Article 451 are adequate; (i) what would be the appropriate level for the leverage ratio for each of the business models indentified in accordance with point (b); (j) whether a range for each level of the leverage ratio should be defined; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/289",

        "content": "Article 418 Valuation of liquid assets 1. The value of a liquid asset to be reported shall be its market value, subject to appropriate haircuts that reflect at least the duration, the credit and liquidity risk and typical repo haircuts in periods of general market stress. The haircuts shall not be less than 15 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). If the institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential close-out of the hedge. 2. Shares or units in CIUs as referred to in Article 416(6) shall be subject to haircuts, looking through to the underlying assets as follows: (a) 0 % for the assets referred to in point (a) of Article 416(1); (b) 5 % for the assets referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (c) 20 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). 3. The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 2 shall be applied as follows: (a) where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1); (b) where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached. 4. Institutions shall develop robust methodologies and processes to calculate and report the market value and haircuts for shares or units in CIUs. Only where they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the materiality of the exposure does not justify the devel­ opment of their own methodologies, institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the haircuts for shares or units in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3: (a) the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution; (b) for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a). The correctness of the calculations by the depository institution or the CIU management company shall be confirmed by an external auditor. Article 419 Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets 1. EBA shall assess the availability for institutions of the liquid assets referred to in point (b) of Article 416(1) in the currencies that are relevant for institutions established in the Union. 2. Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply: (a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows; (b) for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place. 3. The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants. 4. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions set out in this Article. EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the imple­ menting technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the imple­ menting technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, where the competent authorities have applied that treatment before 1 January 2014. 6. Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution provided that the requirements in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk, only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in the first sentence of Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets. 7. Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible in the stock of liquid assets, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 6, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets. Article 417 Operational requirements for holdings of liquid assets The institution shall only report as liquid assets those holdings of liquid assets that meet the following conditions: (a) they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (b) they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk; (c) the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function; (d) a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes: (i) to test the access to the market for these assets; (ii) to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liqui­ dation of assets; (iii) to test the usability of the assets; (iv) to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress; (e) price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including: (i) hedging or other trading strategies; (ii) providing credit enhancements in structured trans­ actions; (iii) covering operational costs. (f) the denomination of the liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows.

        "content": "(97) Good governance structures, transparency and disclosure are essential for sound remuneration policies. In order to ensure adequate transparency to the market of their remuneration structures and the associated risk, insti­ tutions should disclose detailed information on their remuneration policies, practices and, for reasons of confidentiality, aggregated amounts for those members of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the institution. That information should be made available to all stakeholders. Those particular requirements should be without prejudice to more general disclosure requirements concerning remuneration policies applicable horizontally across sectors. Moreover, Member States should be allowed to require institutions to make available more detailed information on remuneration. (98) The recognition of a credit rating agency as an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) should not increase the foreclosure of a market already dominated by three main undertakings. EBA and ESCB central banks, without making the process easier or less demanding, should provide for the recognition of more credit rating agencies as ECAIs as a way to open the market to other undertakings. (99) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 1 ) and Regu­ lation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ), should be fully applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation. (100) Institutions should hold a diversified buffer of liquid assets that they can use to cover liquidity needs in a short term liquidity stress. As it is not possible to know ex ante with certainty which specific assets within each asset class might be subject to shocks ex post, it is appropriate to promote a diversified and high-quality liquidity buffer consisting of different asset categories. A concentration of assets and overreliance on market liquidity creates systemic risk to the financial sector and should be avoided. A broad set of quality assets should therefore be taken into consideration during an initial observation period which will be used for the development of a definition of a liquidity coverage requirement. When making a uniform defi­ nition of liquid assets at least government bonds, and covered bonds traded on transparent markets with an ongoing turnover would be expected to be considered assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality. It would also be appropriate that assets corresponding to Article 416(1)(a) to (c) should be included in the buffer without limitations. When institutions use the liquidity stock, they should put in place a plan to restore their holdings of liquid assets and competent authorities should ensure the adequacy of the plan and its imple­ mentation. (101) The stock of liquid assets should be available at any time to meet the liquidity outflows. The level of liquidity needs in a short term liquidity stress should be determined in a standardised manner so as to ensure a uniform soundness standard and a level playing field. It should be ensured that such a standardised determination has no unintended consequences for financial markets, credit extension and economic growth, also taking into account different business and investment models and funding environments of institutions across the Union. To this end, the liquidity coverage requirement should be subject to an observation period. Based on the obser­ vations and supported by reports from EBA, the Commission should be empowered to adopt a delegated act to introduce in a timely manner a detailed and harmonised liquidity coverage requirement for the Union. In order to ensure global harmonisation in the area of regulation of liquidity any delegated act to introduce the liquidity coverage requirement should be comparable to the liquidity coverage ratio set out in the final international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring of the BCBS taking into account Union and national specificities. (102) To that end, during the observation period, EBA should review and assess, inter alia the appropriateness of a threshold of 60 % on level 1 liquid assets, a cap of 75 % of inflows to outflows and the phase-in of the liquidity coverage requirement from 60 % from 1 January 2015 increasing on a graduated basis to 100 %. When assessing and reporting on the uniform definitions of the stock of liquid assets, EBA should have regard to the BCBS definition of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the basis of its analysis, taking Union and national specificities into account. While EBA should identify those currencies where the needs of insti­ tutions established in the Union for liquid assets exceeds the availability of those liquid assets in that currency, EBA should also annually examine whether derogations, including those identified in this Regulation, should be applied. In addition, EBA should assess annually whether in relation to any such derogation as well as derogations already identified in this Regulation, any additional conditions should be attached to their use by institutions established in the Union or whether existing conditions should be revised. EBA should submit the results of its analysis in an annual report to the Commission. EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/13 ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31.

EBA, together with ESMA, shall by 2 January 2015 report on the functioning of this Regulation with the related obligations under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and in particular with regard to institutions operating a central counterparty, in order to avoid duplication of requirements for derivative transactions and thereby avoid increased regu­ latory risk and increased costs for monitoring by competent authorities. 2. EBA shall monitor and evaluate the operation of the provisions for own funds requirements for exposures to a central counterparty as set out in Section 9 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three. By 1 January 2015 EBA shall report to the Commission on the impact and effectiveness of such provisions. 3. By 31 December 2016 the Commission shall review and report on the reconciliation of this Regulation with the related obligations under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the own funds requirements as set out in Section 9 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, and, if appropriate, a legislative proposal. Article 516 Long-term financing By 31 December 2015 the Commission shall report on the impact of this Regulation on the encouragement of long-term investments in growth promoting infrastructure. Article 517 Definition of eligible capital By 31 December 2014 the Commission shall review and report on the appropriateness of the definition of eligible capital being applied for the purposes of Title III of Part Two and Part Four and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, and, if appropriate, a legislative proposal. Article 518 Review of capital instruments which may be written down or converted at the point of non-viability By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall review and report on whether this Regulation should contain a requirement that Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital instruments are to be written down in the event of a determination that an institution is no longer viable. The Commission shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with a legislative proposal if appropriate. Article 519 Deduction of defined benefit pension fund assets from Common Equity Tier 1 items EBA shall by 30 June 2014 prepare a report on whether the revised IAS 19 in conjunction with the deduction of net pension assets as set out in Article 36(1)(e) and changes in the net pension liabilities lead to undue volatility of institutions' own funds. Taking into account the EBA report, the Commission shall by 31 December 2014 prepare a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the issue referred to in the first paragraph, together with a legislative proposal, if appro­ priate, to introduce a treatment which adjusts defined net benefit pension fund assets or liabilities for the calculation of own funds. TITLE III AMENDMENTS Article 520 Amendment of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 is amended as follows: (1) the following Chapter is added in Title IV: \"CHAPTER 4 Calculations and reporting for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 Article 50a Calculation of K CCP 1.

        "content": "(111) Pending the introduction of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) as a binding minimum standard, institutions should observe a general funding obligation. The general funding obligation should not be a ratio requirement. If, pending the introduction of the NSFR, a stable funding ratio is introduced as a minimum standard by way of a national provision, institutions should comply with this minimum standard accordingly. (112) Apart from short-term liquidity needs, institutions should also adopt funding structures that are stable over a longer term horizon. In December 2010, the BCBS agreed that the NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018 and that the BCBS will put in place rigorous reporting processes to monitor the ratio during a transition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial markets, credit extension and economic growth, addressing unintended consequences as necessary. The BCBS thus agreed that the NSFR will be subject to an observation period and will include a review clause. In that context, EBA should, based on reporting required by this Regulation, evaluate how a stable funding requirement should be designed. Based on this evaluation, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council together with any appropriate proposals in order to introduce such a requirement by 2018. (113) Weaknesses in corporate governance in a number of institutions have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the banking sector which led to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems. (114) In order to facilitate the monitoring of institutions' corporate governance practices and improve market discipline, institutions should publicly disclose their corporate governance arrangements. Their management bodies should approve and publicly disclose a statement providing assurance to the public that these arrangements are adequate and efficient. (115) In order to take account of the diversity of business models of institutions in the internal market certain long-term structural requirements such as the NSFR and the leverage ratio should be examined closely with a view of promoting a variety of sound banking structures which have been and should continue to of service to the Union's economy. (116) For the continuous provision of financial services to households and firms a stable funding structure is necessary. Long-term funding flows in bank-based financial systems in many Member States may generally possess different characteristics than those found in other international markets. In addition, specific funding structures may have developed in Member States to provide stable financing for long-term investment, including decentralised banking structures to channel liquidity or specialised mortgage securities which trade on highly liquid markets or are a welcome investment for long-term investors. Those structural factors should be carefully considered. It is essential to that purpose that, once international standards are finalised, EBA and the ESRB, based on reporting required by this Regulation, evaluate how a stable funding requirement should be designed fully taking into account the diversity of funding structures in the banking market in the Union. (117) In order to ensure progressive convergence between the level of own funds and the prudential adjustments applied to the definition of own funds across the Union and to the definition of own funds laid down in this Regulation during a transition period, the phasing in of the own funds requirements of this Regulation should occur gradually. It is vital to ensure that this phasing in is consistent with the recent enhancements made by Member States to the required levels of own funds and to the definition of own funds in place in the Member States. To that end, during the transition period the competent authorities should determine within defined lower and upper limits how rapidly to introduce the required level of own funds and prudential adjustments laid down in this Regulation. (118) In order to facilitate smooth transition from divergent prudential adjustments currently applied in Member States to the set of prudential adjustments laid down in this Regulation, competent authorities should be able during a transition period to continue to require institu­ tions, to a limited extent, to make prudential adjustments to own funds that are a derogation from this Regulation. (119) In order to ensure that institutions have sufficient time to meet the new required levels and definition of own funds, certain capital instruments that do not comply with the definition of own funds laid down in this Regu­ lation should be phased out between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2021. In addition, certain state-injected instruments should be recognised fully in own funds for a limited period. Furthermore, share premium accounts related to items that qualified as own funds under national transposition measures for Directive 2006/48/EC should under certain circumstances qualify as Common Equity Tier 1. (120) In order to ensure progressive convergence towards uniform rules on disclosure by institutions to provide market participants with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the risk profile of individual insti­ tutions, disclosure requirements should be phased in gradually.

Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits by clients that are not financial customers to the extent they do not fall under paragraphs 3 and 4 by 40 % and shall multiply the amount of these liabilities covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent Deposit Guarantee Scheme in a third country by 20 %. 6. Institutions shall take outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II into account on a net basis across counterparties and shall multiply them by 100 % in the case of a net outflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416. 7. Institutions shall separately report other liabilities that do not fall under paragraphs 1 to 5. 8. Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage on a case-by-case basis, to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7, when all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the depositor is: (i) a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution; (ii) linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC; (iii) an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7); (iv) the central institution or a member of a network compliant with Article 400 (2)(d); (b) there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market- wide stress scenario; (c) a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the depositor by way of derogation from Article 425; (d) the institution and the depositor are established in the same Member State. 9. Competent authorities may waive the conditions set out in point (d) of paragraph 8 where point (b) of Article 20(1) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in point (b) of Article 20(1). The fulfilment of the conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities. 10. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 9. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 423 Additional Outflows 1. Collateral other than assets referred to in Article 416(1)(a), (b) and (c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 20 %. 2. Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities all contracts entered into the contractual conditions of which lead, within 30 days following a material deterioration of the credit quality of the institution, to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs. If the competent authorities consider such contracts material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the insti­ tution to add an additional outflow for those contracts corresponding to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in the credit quality of the institution such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities. 3. The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the institution's derivatives transactions, financing transactions and other contracts if material. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the conditions of application in relation to the notion of materiality and methods for the measurement of this additional outflow.

EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1). The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4. The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall consider whether, and if, to what extent standby credit facilities referred to in point (e) of Article 416(1) should be included as liquid assets in light of international development and taking into account European specificities, including the way monetary policy is performed in the Union. EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions: (a) minimum trade volume of the assets; (b) minimum outstanding volume of the assets; (c) transparent pricing and post-trade information; (d) credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) proven record of price stability; (f) average volume traded and average trade size; (g) maximum bid/ask spread; (h) remaining time to maturity; (i) minimum turnover ratio. 5. By 31 January 2014, EBA shall furthermore report on the following: (a) uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality; (b) the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which: (i) a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise insti­ tutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations; (ii) regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation; (iii) the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments; (c) the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments. Article 510 Net Stable Funding Requirements 1. By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending. In particular EBA shall analyse the impact of stable sources of funding on the refinancing structures of different banking models in the Union.

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 149 Conditions to revert to the use of less sophisticated approaches 1. An institution that uses the IRB Approach for a particular exposure class or type of exposure shall not stop using that approach and use instead the Standardised Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts unless the following conditions are met: (a) the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the use of the Standardised Approach is not proposed in order to reduce the own funds requirement of the institution, is necessary on the basis of nature and complexity of the institution's total exposures of this type and would not have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the institution or its ability to manage risk effectively; (b) the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority. 2. Institutions which have obtained permission under Article 151(9) to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, shall not revert to the use of LGD values and conversion factors referred to in Article 151(8) unless the following conditions are met: (a) the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the use of LGDs and conversion factors laid down in Article 151(8) for a certain exposure class or type of exposure is not proposed in order to reduce the own funds requirement of the institution, is necessary on the basis of nature and complexity of the institution's total exposures of this type and would not have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the institution or its ability to manage risk effectively; (b) the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority. 3. The application of paragraphs 1 and 2 is subject to the conditions for rolling out the IRB Approach determined by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 148 and the permission for permanent partial use referred to in Article 150. Article 150 Conditions for permanent partial use 1. Where institutions have received the prior permission of the competent authorities, institutions permitted to use the IRB Approach in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for one or more exposure classes may apply the Standardised Approach for the following exposures: (a) the exposure class laid down in Article 147(2)(a), where the number of material counterparties is limited and it would be unduly burdensome for the institution to implement a rating system for these counterparties; (b) the exposure class laid down in Article 147(2)(b), where the number of material counterparties is limited and it would be unduly burdensome for the institution to implement a rating system for these counterparties; (c) exposures in non-significant business units as well as exposure classes or types of exposures that are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile; (d) exposures to central governments and central banks of the Member States and their regional governments, local auth­ orities, administrative bodies and public sector entities provided: (i) there is no difference in risk between the exposures to that central government and central bank and those other exposures because of specific public arrangements; and (ii) exposures to the central government and central bank are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 114(2), (4) or (5); (e) exposures of an institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary or a subsidiary of its parent undertaking provided that the counterparty is an institution or a financial holding company, mixed financial holding company, financial institution, asset management company or ancillary services undertaking subject to appro­ priate prudential requirements or an undertaking linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC; EN L 176/94 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

Exposures to regional governments or local authorities shall be risk-weighted as exposures to institutions unless they are treated as exposures to central governments under para­ graphs 2 or 4 or receive a risk weight as specified in paragraph 5. The preferential treatment for short-term exposures specified in Article 119(2) and Article 120(2) shall not be applied. 2. Exposures to regional governments or local authorities shall be treated as exposures to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established where there is no difference in risk between such exposures because of the specific revenue-raising powers of the former, and the existence of specific institutional arrangements the effect of which is to reduce their risk of default. EBA shall maintain a publicly available database of all regional governments and local authorities within the Union which relevant competent authorities treat as exposures to their central governments. 3. Exposures to churches or religious communities constituted in the form of a legal person under public law shall, in so far as they raise taxes in accordance with legislation conferring on them the right to do so, be treated as exposures to regional governments and local authorities. In this case, paragraph 2 shall not apply and, for the purposes of Article 150(1)(a), permission to apply the Standardised Approach shall not be excluded. 4. When competent authorities of a third country juris­ diction which applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union treat exposures to regional governments or local authorities as exposures to their central government and there is no difference in risk between such exposures because of the specific revenue- raising powers of regional government or local authorities and to specific institutional arrangements to reduce the risk of default, institutions may risk weight exposures to such regional governments and local authorities in the same manner. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in this paragraph to the third country where the relevant competent authorities had approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014. 5. Exposures to regional governments or local authorities of the Member States that are not referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4 and are denominated and funded in the domestic currency of that regional government and local authority shall be assigned a risk weight of 20 %. Article 116 Exposures to public sector entities 1. Exposures to public sector entities for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available shall be assigned a risk weight according to the credit quality step to which exposures to the central government of the jurisdiction in which the public sector entity is incorporated are assigned in accordance with the following Table 2: Table 2 Credit quality step to which central government is assigned 1 2 3 4 5 6 Risk weight 20 % 50 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 150 % For exposures to public sector entities incorporated in countries where the central government is unrated, the risk weight shall be 100 %. 2. Exposures to public sector entities for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available shall be treated in accordance with Article 120. The preferential treatment for short-term exposures specified in Articles 119(2) and 120(2), shall not be applied to those entities. 3. For exposures to public sector entities with an original maturity of three months or less, the risk weight shall be 20 %. 4. In exceptional circumstances, exposures to public-sector entities may be treated as exposures to the central government, regional government or local authority in whose jurisdiction they are established where in the opinion of the competent authorities of this jurisdiction there is no difference in risk between such exposures because of the existence of an appro­ priate guarantee by the central government, regional government or local authority. 5.

Where a credit assessment exists for a specific issuing programme or facility to which the item constituting the exposure belongs, this credit assessment shall be used to determine the risk weight to be assigned to that item. 2.

Short-term credit assessments may only be used for short- term asset and off-balance sheet items constituting exposures to institutions and corporates. 2. Any short-term credit assessment shall only apply to the item the short-term credit assessment refers to, and it shall not be used to derive risk weights for any other item, except in the following cases: (a) if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 150 % risk weight, then all unrated unsecured exposures on that obligor whether short-term or long-term shall also be assigned a 150 % risk weight; (b) if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 50 % risk-weight, no unrated short-term exposure shall be assigned a risk weight lower than 100 %. Article 141 Domestic and foreign currency items A credit assessment that refers to an item denominated in the obligor's domestic currency cannot be used to derive a risk weight for another exposure on that same obligor that is denominated in a foreign currency. When an exposure arises through an institution's participation in a loan that has been extended by a multilateral development bank whose preferred creditor status is recognised in the market, the credit assessment on the obligors' domestic currency item may be used for risk weighting purposes.

EBA shall assess the availability for institutions of the liquid assets referred to in point (b) of Article 416(1) in the currencies that are relevant for institutions established in the Union. 2. Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply: (a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows; (b) for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place. 3. The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants. 4. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions set out in this Article. EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the imple­ menting technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1). The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider: (a) other categories of assets, in particular residential mortgage- backed securities of high liquidity and credit quality; (b) other categories of central bank eligible securities or loans, for example local government bonds and commercial paper; and (c) other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets, for example equities listed on a recognised exchange, gold, major index linked equity instruments, guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and funds based on those assets. 4. The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall consider whether, and if, to what extent standby credit facilities referred to in point (e) of Article 416(1) should be included as liquid assets in light of international development and taking into account European specificities, including the way monetary policy is performed in the Union. EBA shall in particular test the adequacy of the following criteria and the appropriate levels for such definitions: (a) minimum trade volume of the assets; (b) minimum outstanding volume of the assets; (c) transparent pricing and post-trade information; (d) credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2; (e) proven record of price stability; (f) average volume traded and average trade size; (g) maximum bid/ask spread; (h) remaining time to maturity; (i) minimum turnover ratio. 5. By 31 January 2014, EBA shall furthermore report on the following: (a) uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality; (b) the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which: (i) a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise insti­ tutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations; (ii) regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation; (iii) the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments; (c) the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments. Article 510 Net Stable Funding Requirements 1. By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending. In particular EBA shall analyse the impact of stable sources of funding on the refinancing structures of different banking models in the Union.

The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to: (a) the excess collateral the institution holds that can be contractually called at any time by the counterparty; (b) collateral that is due to be returned to a counterparty; (c) collateral that corresponds to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 that can be substituted for assets corresponding to assets that would not qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 without the consent of the institution. 6. Deposits received as collateral shall not be considered liabilities for the purposes of Article 422 but will be subject to the provisions of this Article where applicable. Article 424 Outflows from credit and liquidity facilities 1. Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416. The collateral to be provided shall not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given the counterparty's own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over the next 30 days. 2.

The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions: (a) they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk; (b) they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers; (c) they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets. 4. The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling such an SSPE to purchase assets other than securities from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 % to the extent that it exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and where the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased. 5. The institutions shall report the maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days. This applies in particular to the following: (a) liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3; (b) arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE; (c) facilities extended to credit institutions; (d) facilities extended to financial institutions and investment firms.

Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, where the competent authorities have applied that treatment before 1 January 2014. 6. Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution provided that the requirements in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk, only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in the first sentence of Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets. 7. Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible in the stock of liquid assets, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 6, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets. Article 417 Operational requirements for holdings of liquid assets The institution shall only report as liquid assets those holdings of liquid assets that meet the following conditions: (a) they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (b) they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk; (c) the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function; (d) a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes: (i) to test the access to the market for these assets; (ii) to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liqui­ dation of assets; (iii) to test the usability of the assets; (iv) to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress; (e) price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including: (i) hedging or other trading strategies; (ii) providing credit enhancements in structured trans­ actions; (iii) covering operational costs.

By 31 December 2015, the Commission shall, after consulting EBA and ESMA and in the light of discussions with the competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms and of firms referred to in points (2)(b) and (c) of Article 4(1). Where appro­ priate the report shall be followed by a legislative proposal. Article 509 Liquidity requirements 1. EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 415(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, non-financial end-users, the banking industry, competent authorities and the ESCB central banks annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission on whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Part Six based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall take due account of markets and international regulatory developments as well as of the interactions of the liquidity coverage requirement with other prudential requirements under this Regulation such as the risk based capital ratios as set out in Article 92 and the leverage ratio. The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on the report referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. EBA shall in the report referred to in paragraph 1 assess the following in particular: (a) the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its appli­ cation, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing; (b) the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2); (c) the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account inter­ national regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1); (d) the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State; (e) the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %; (f) the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons; (g) the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments; (h) derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject; (i) the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah- compliant banks; (j) the definition of circumstances of stress, including prin­ ciples for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance; (k) the definition of established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c); EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/287",

Institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the institution rigorously applies the following for the whole category of those deposits, unless in individually justified circumstances of hardship for the depositor: (a) within 30 days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit; or (b) for early withdrawals within 30 days, the depositor has to pay a penalty that includes the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and the contractual maturity date plus a material penalty that does not have to exceed the interest due for the time elapsed between the date of deposit and the date of withdrawal. Article 422 Outflows on other liabilities 1. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from the institution's own operating expenses by 0 %. 2. Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 by: (a) 0 % up to the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418 if they are collateralised by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416; (b) 100 % over the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418, if they are collateralized by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416; (c) 100 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416, with the exception of transactions covered by points (d) and (e) of this paragraph; (d) 25 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 and the lender is the central government, a public sector entity of the Member State in which the credit institution has been authorised or has established a branch, or a multilateral development bank.

Deposits from credit institutions placed at central credit insti­ tutions that are considered as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416(1)(f) shall be multiplied by 100 % outflow rate. 4. Clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning. Pending a uniform definition of an established operational rela­ tionship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria to identify an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising their operational functioning and shall report these criteria to the competent authorities. Competent authorities may, in the absence of a uniform defi­ nition, provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.

In order to ensure adequate transparency to the market of their remuneration structures and the associated risk, insti­ tutions should disclose detailed information on their remuneration policies, practices and, for reasons of confidentiality, aggregated amounts for those members of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the institution. That information should be made available to all stakeholders. Those particular requirements should be without prejudice to more general disclosure requirements concerning remuneration policies applicable horizontally across sectors. Moreover, Member States should be allowed to require institutions to make available more detailed information on remuneration. (98) The recognition of a credit rating agency as an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) should not increase the foreclosure of a market already dominated by three main undertakings. EBA and ESCB central banks, without making the process easier or less demanding, should provide for the recognition of more credit rating agencies as ECAIs as a way to open the market to other undertakings.

(100) Institutions should hold a diversified buffer of liquid assets that they can use to cover liquidity needs in a short term liquidity stress. As it is not possible to know ex ante with certainty which specific assets within each asset class might be subject to shocks ex post, it is appropriate to promote a diversified and high-quality liquidity buffer consisting of different asset categories. A concentration of assets and overreliance on market liquidity creates systemic risk to the financial sector and should be avoided. A broad set of quality assets should therefore be taken into consideration during an initial observation period which will be used for the development of a definition of a liquidity coverage requirement. When making a uniform defi­ nition of liquid assets at least government bonds, and covered bonds traded on transparent markets with an ongoing turnover would be expected to be considered assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality. It would also be appropriate that assets corresponding to Article 416(1)(a) to (c) should be included in the buffer without limitations. When institutions use the liquidity stock, they should put in place a plan to restore their holdings of liquid assets and competent authorities should ensure the adequacy of the plan and its imple­ mentation. (101) The stock of liquid assets should be available at any time to meet the liquidity outflows. The level of liquidity needs in a short term liquidity stress should be determined in a standardised manner so as to ensure a uniform soundness standard and a level playing field. It should be ensured that such a standardised determination has no unintended consequences for financial markets, credit extension and economic growth, also taking into account different business and investment models and funding environments of institutions across the Union. To this end, the liquidity coverage requirement should be subject to an observation period. Based on the obser­ vations and supported by reports from EBA, the Commission should be empowered to adopt a delegated act to introduce in a timely manner a detailed and harmonised liquidity coverage requirement for the Union. In order to ensure global harmonisation in the area of regulation of liquidity any delegated act to introduce the liquidity coverage requirement should be comparable to the liquidity coverage ratio set out in the final international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring of the BCBS taking into account Union and national specificities. (102) To that end, during the observation period, EBA should review and assess, inter alia the appropriateness of a threshold of 60 % on level 1 liquid assets, a cap of 75 % of inflows to outflows and the phase-in of the liquidity coverage requirement from 60 % from 1 January 2015 increasing on a graduated basis to 100 %. When assessing and reporting on the uniform definitions of the stock of liquid assets, EBA should have regard to the BCBS definition of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the basis of its analysis, taking Union and national specificities into account. While EBA should identify those currencies where the needs of insti­ tutions established in the Union for liquid assets exceeds the availability of those liquid assets in that currency, EBA should also annually examine whether derogations, including those identified in this Regulation, should be applied. In addition, EBA should assess annually whether in relation to any such derogation as well as derogations already identified in this Regulation, any additional conditions should be attached to their use by institutions established in the Union or whether existing conditions should be revised. EBA should submit the results of its analysis in an annual report to the Commission. EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/13 ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31.

By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those para­ graphs. By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another insti­ tution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed. Article 425 Inflows 1. Institutions shall report their liquidity inflows. Capped liquidity inflows shall be the liquidity inflows limited to 75 % of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions and qualifying for the treatments set out in Article 113(6) or (7) from this limit. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from monies due from borrowers and bond investors related to mortgage lending funded by bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) or (6) or by bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC from this limit. Insti­ tutions may exempt inflows from promotional loans that the institutions have passed through. Subject to the prior approval of the competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis, the institution may fully or partially exempt inflows where the provider is a parent or a subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC. 2. The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the institution has no reason to expect non-performance within the 30-day time horizon. Liquidity inflows shall be reported in full with the following inflows reported separately: (a) monies due from customers that are not financial customers for the purposes of principal payment shall be reduced by 50 % of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 as referred to in point (d) of this paragraph. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point, institutions that have received a commitment referred to in Article 424(6) in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans; (b) monies due from trade financing transactions referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 162(3) with a residual maturity of up to 30 days, shall be taken into account in full as inflows; (c) assets with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow provided that the contract allows the bank to withdraw and request payment within 30 days; (d) monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due; (e) monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow; (f) monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided there is no double counting with liquid assets; (g) any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account. 3. Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416. 4. By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider; EN L 176/250 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013",

    "reference_answer": "Institutions may use residential and commercial immovable property as eligible collateral when two conditions are met: (1) the value of the property does not materially depend upon the credit quality of the obligor, and (2) the risk of the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but rather on the borrower's capacity to repay the debt from other sources. This means the repayment shouldn't materially depend on cash flow generated by the property serving as collateral.",
    "generated_answer": "Institutions can use residential and commercial immovable property as eligible collateral when: 1) the property value does not materially depend on the obligor's credit quality; 2) the borrower's risk does not materially depend on the property's performance but on their capacity to repay from other sources; 3) the repayment doesn't materially depend on cash flow generated by the property. Institutions may be exempt from the second requirement when properties are in Member States with well-developed property markets showing loss rates below specified thresholds (0.3% for loans up to certain LTV limits and 0.5% overall). The property must meet legal certainty requirements, including enforceable mortgages, proper filing, and ability to realize value in reasonable time.

Article 231 Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in the case of mixed pools of collateral 1. An institution shall calculate the value of LGD* that it shall use as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3 in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 where both the following conditions are met: (a) the institution uses the IRB Approach to calculate risk- weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts; (b) an exposure is collateralised by both financial collateral and other eligible collateral. 2. Institutions shall be required to subdivide the volatility- adjusted value of the exposure, obtained by applying the vola­ tility adjustment as set out in Article 223(5) to the value of the exposure, into parts so as to obtain a part covered by eligible financial collateral, a part covered by receivables, a part covered by commercial immovable property collateral or residential property collateral, a part covered by other eligible collateral, and the unsecured part, as applicable. 3.

Institutions shall consider an exposure or any part of an exposure as fully and completely secured for the purposes of paragraph 1 only if the following conditions are met: (a) the value of the property shall not materially depend upon the credit quality of the borrower. Institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the property and the performance of the borrower from their determination of the materiality of such dependence; (b) the risk of the borrower shall not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources, and as a consequence, the repayment of the facility shall not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral. For those other sources, institutions shall determine maximum loan-to-income ratios as part of their lending policy and obtain suitable evidence of the relevant income when granting the loan. (c) the requirements set out in Article 208 and the valuation rules set out in Article 229(1) are met; (d) unless otherwise determined under Article 124(2), the part of the loan to which the 35 % risk weight is assigned does not exceed 80 % of the market value of the property in question or 80 % of the mortgage lending value of the property in question in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provi­ sions.

Institutions shall provide own estimates of LGDs subject to requirements as specified in Section 6 and permission of the competent authorities granted in accordance with Article 143. For dilution risk of purchased receivables, an LGD value of 75 % shall be used. If an institution can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased receivables into PDs and LGDs in a reliable manner, the institution may use its own LGD estimate. 2.

Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall use E* as calculated under Article 223(5) as the exposure value for the purposes of Article 113. In the case of off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I, institutions shall use E* as the value to which the percentages indicated in Article 111(1) shall be applied to arrive at the exposure value. 2. Under the IRB Approach, institutions shall use the effective LGD (LGD*) as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3. Institutions shall calculate LGD* as follows: LGD ä ¼ LGD · E ä E where: LGD = the LGD that would apply to the exposure under Chapter 3 where the exposure was not collateralised; E = the exposure value in accordance with Article 223(3); E* = the fully adjusted exposure value in accordance with Article 223(5). Article 229 Valuation principles for other eligible collateral under the IRB Approach 1. For immovable property collateral, the collateral shall be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the market value. An institution shall require the independent valuer to document the market value in a transparent and clear manner. In those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions the property may instead be valued by an independent valuer at or at less than the mortgage lending value. Institutions shall require the independent valuer not to take into account speculative elements in the assessment of the mortgage lending value and to document that value in a trans­ parent and clear manner.

Institutions shall use LGD* calculated in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph 2 as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3. Where the ratio of the value of the collateral (C) to the exposure value (E) is below the required minimum collateralisation level of the exposure (C*) as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be the LGD laid down in Chapter 3 for uncollateralised exposures to the counterparty. For this purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) by using a conversion factor or percentage of 100 % rather than the conversion factors or percentages indicated in those paragraphs. Where the ratio of the value of the collateral to the exposure value exceeds a second, higher threshold level of C** as laid down in Table 5, LGD* shall be that prescribed in Table 5. Where the required level of collateralisation C** is not achieved in respect of the exposure as a whole, institutions shall consider the exposure to be two exposures — one corresponding to the part in respect of which the required level of collateralisation C** is achieved and one corresponding to the remainder. 2.

To be eligible for the retail treatment, purchased receivables shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184 and the following conditions: (a) the institution has purchased the receivables from unrelated, third party sellers, and its exposure to the obligor of the receivable does not include any exposures that are directly or indirectly originated by the institution itself; (b) the purchased receivables shall be generated on an arm's- length basis between the seller and the obligor. As such, inter-company accounts receivables and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible; (c) the purchasing institution has a claim on all proceeds from the purchased receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds; and (d) the portfolio of purchased receivables is sufficiently diver­ sified. 6. For purchased receivables, refundable purchase discounts, collateral or partial guarantees that provide first-loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as first-loss positions under the IRB securitisation framework. 7. For hybrid pools of purchased retail receivables where purchasing institutions cannot separate exposures secured by immovable property collateral and qualifying revolving retail exposures from other retail exposures, the retail risk weight function producing the highest capital requirements for those exposures shall apply. Article 155 Risk weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures 1. Institutions shall determine their risk-weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures, excluding those deducted in accordance with Part Two or subject to a 250 % risk weight in accordance with Article 48, in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. An institution may apply different approaches to different equity portfolios where the institution itself uses different approaches for internal risk management purposes. Where an institution uses different approaches, the choice of the PD / LGD approach or the internal models approach shall be made consistently, including over time and with the approach used for the internal risk management of the relevant equity exposure, and shall not be determined by regulatory arbitrage considerations. Institutions may treat equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings according to the treatment of other non credit- obligation assets. 2. Under the Simple risk weight approach, the risk weighted exposure amount shall be calculated according to the formula: Risk – weighted exposure amount ¼ RW ä exposure value, where: Risk weight (RW) = 190 % for private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios. Risk weight (RW) = 290 % for exchange traded equity exposures. Risk weight (RW) = 370 % for all other equity exposures. Short cash positions and derivative instruments held in the non- trading book are permitted to offset long positions in the same individual stocks provided that these instruments have been explicitly designated as hedges of specific equity exposures and that they provide a hedge for at least another year. Other short positions are to be treated as if they are long positions with the relevant risk weight assigned to the absolute value of each position. In the context of maturity mismatched positions, the method is that for corporate exposures as set out in Article 162(5). Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. 3. Under the PD/LGD approach, risk weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated according to the formulas in Article 153(1). If institutions do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights. At the individual exposure level the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the exposure value multiplied by 12,5. Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. This shall be subject to an LGD of 90 % on the exposure to the provider of the hedge. For private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios an LGD of 65 % may be used.

Where the assessment demonstrates that the risk weights set out in Article 125(2) and Article 126(2) do not reflect the actual risks related to one or more property segments of such exposures, fully secured by mortgages on residential property or on commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of its territory, the competent authorities shall set, for those property segments of exposures, a higher risk weight corresponding to the actual risks. The competent authorities shall consult EBA on the adjustments to the risk weights and criteria applied, which will be calculated in accordance with the criteria set out in this paragraph as specified by the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. EBA shall publish the risk weights and criteria that the competent authorities set for exposures referred to in Articles 125, 126 and 199. 3. When competent authorities set a higher risk weight or stricter criteria, institutions shall have a 6-month transitional period to apply the new risk weight. 4. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify: (a) the rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value referred to in paragraph 1; (b) the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 that competent authorities shall take into account when determining higher risk-weights, in particular the term of \"financial stability considerations\".

Unless otherwise decided by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 124(2), exposures fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential property shall be treated as follows: (a) exposures or any part of an exposure fully and completely secured by mortgages on residential property which is or shall be occupied or let by the owner, or the beneficial owner in the case of personal investment companies, shall be assigned a risk weight of 35 %; (b) exposures to a tenant under a property leasing transaction concerning residential property under which the institution is the lessor and the tenant has an option to purchase, shall be assigned a risk weight of 35 % provided that the exposure of the institution is fully and completely secured by its ownership of the property. 2. Institutions shall consider an exposure or any part of an exposure as fully and completely secured for the purposes of paragraph 1 only if the following conditions are met: (a) the value of the property shall not materially depend upon the credit quality of the borrower. Institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the property and the performance of the borrower from their determination of the materiality of such dependence; (b) the risk of the borrower shall not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources, and as a consequence, the repayment of the facility shall not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral. For those other sources, institutions shall determine maximum loan-to-income ratios as part of their lending policy and obtain suitable evidence of the relevant income when granting the loan. (c) the requirements set out in Article 208 and the valuation rules set out in Article 229(1) are met; (d) unless otherwise determined under Article 124(2), the part of the loan to which the 35 % risk weight is assigned does not exceed 80 % of the market value of the property in question or 80 % of the mortgage lending value of the property in question in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provi­ sions.

For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, 'debt securities issued by central governments or central banks' shall include all the following: (a) debt securities issued by regional governments or local auth­ orities, exposures to which are treated as exposures to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are estab­ lished under Article 115(2); (b) debt securities issued by public sector entities which are treated as exposures to central governments in accordance with Article 116(4); (c) debt securities issued by multilateral development banks to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under Article 117(2); (d) debt securities issued by international organisations which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 118. 3. For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, 'debt securities issued by institutions' shall include all the following: (a) debt securities issued by regional governments or local auth­ orities other than those debt securities referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2; (b) debt securities issued by public sector entities, exposures to which are treated in accordance with Article 116(1) and (2); (c) debt securities issued by multilateral development banks other than those to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under Article 117(2). 4. An institution may use debt securities that are issued by other institutions and that do not have a credit assessment by an ECAI as eligible collateral where those debt securities fulfil all the following criteria: (a) they are listed on a recognised exchange; (b) they qualify as senior debt; (c) all other rated issues by the issuing institution of the same seniority have a credit assessment by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions or short term exposures under Chapter 2; (d) the lending institution has no information to suggest that the issue would justify a credit assessment below that indicated in point (c); (e) the market liquidity of the instrument is sufficient for these purposes. 5. Institutions may use units or shares in CIUs as eligible collateral where all the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the units or shares have a daily public price quote; (b) the CIUs are limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under paragraphs 1 and 2; (c) the CIUs meet the conditions laid down in Article 132(3). Where a CIU invests in shares or units of another CIU, conditions laid down in points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph shall apply equally to any such underlying CIU. The use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge permitted investments shall not prevent units or shares in that under­ taking from being eligible as collateral. 6. For the purposes of paragraph 5, where a CIU ('the original CIU') or any of its underlying CIUs are not limited to investing in instruments that are eligible under paragraphs 1 and 4, institutions may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral to an amount equal to the value of the eligible assets held by that CIU under the assumption that that CIU or any of its underlying CIUs have invested in non-eligible assets to the maximum extent allowed under their respective mandates. Where any underlying CIUs has underlying CIUs of its own, institutions may use units or shares in the original CIU as eligible collateral provided that they apply the methodology laid down in the first subparagraph EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/125",
