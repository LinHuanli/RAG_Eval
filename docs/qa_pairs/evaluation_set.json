    "question": "How can institutions with permission from competent authorities calculate positions for interest rate risk on derivative instruments?",
    "answer": "Institutions that mark to market and manage interest-rate risk on derivative instruments on a discounted-cash-flow basis can, with permission from competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate positions. These models must generate positions with the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows, assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve. The positions calculated using these models shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.",

EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, referred to in paragraph 2 in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options and warrants. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 4. Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in paragraph 3, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013. Article 330 Swaps Swaps shall be treated for interest-rate risk purposes on the same basis as on-balance-sheet instruments. Thus, an interest- rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself. Article 331 Interest rate risk on derivative instruments 1. Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensi­ tivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments. 2. Institutions which do not use models under paragraph 1 may, treat as fully offsetting any positions in derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 which meet the following conditions at least: (a) the positions are of the same value and denominated in the same currency; (b) the reference rate (for floating-rate positions) or coupon (for fixed-rate positions) is closely matched; (c) the next interest-fixing date or, for fixed coupon positions, residual maturity corresponds with the following limits: (i) less than one month hence: same day; (ii) between one month and one year hence: within seven days; (iii) over one year hence: within 30 days. Article 332 Credit Derivatives 1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the 'protection seller'), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwith­ standing the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows: (a) a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation; (b) a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds; EN L 176/202 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013"

Where the possible reduction in risk weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by this securitisation is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authorities may decide on a case-by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered to have been transferred to third parties.

    "answer": "According to the de Larosière report, microprudential supervision cannot effectively safeguard financial stability without adequately taking account of developments at the macro level, while macroprudential oversight is not meaningful unless it can somehow impact supervision at the micro level. This highlights the interdependence of these two supervision approaches and the necessity for close cooperation between EBA and the ESRB for effective financial oversight.",

        "content": "(31) The de Larosière report stated that microprudential supervision cannot effectively safeguard financial stability without adequately taking account of devel­ opments at macro level, while macroprudential oversight is not meaningful unless it can somehow impact on supervision at the micro level. Close cooperation between EBA and the ESRB is essential to give full effectiveness to the functioning of the ESRB and follow up to its warnings and recommendations. In particular, EBA should be able to transmit to the ESRB all relevant information gathered by competent auth­ orities in accordance with the reporting obligations set out in this Regulation. (32) Considering the devastating effects of the latest financial crisis the overall objectives of this Regulation are to encourage economically useful banking activities that serve the general interest and to discourage unsustainable financial speculation without real added value. This implies a comprehensive reform of the ways savings are channelled into productive investments. In order to safeguard a sustainable and diverse banking environment in the Union, competent authorities should be empowered to impose higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions that are able, due to their business activities, to pose a threat to the global economy. (33) Equivalent financial requirements for institutions holding money or securities belonging to their clients are necessary to ensure similar safeguards for savers and fair conditions of competition between comparable groups of institutions. (34) Since institutions in the internal market are engaged in direct competition, monitoring requirements should be equivalent throughout the Union taking into account the different risk profiles of the institutions. (35) Whenever in the course of supervision it is necessary to determine the amount of the consolidated own funds of a group of institutions, the calculation should be effected in accordance with this Regulation. (36) According to this Regulation own funds requirements apply on an individual and consolidated basis, unless competent authorities do not apply supervision on an individual basis where they deem this appropriate. Indi­ vidual, consolidated and cross-border consolidated super­ vision are useful tools in overseeing institutions. (37) In order to ensure adequate solvency of institutions within a group it is essential that the capital requirements apply on the basis of the consolidated situation of those institutions within the group. In order to ensure that own funds are appropriately distributed within the group and available to protect savings where needed, the capital requirements should apply to individual insti­ tutions within a group, unless this objective can be effec­ tively achieved otherwise. (38) The minority interests arising from intermediate financial holding companies that are subject to the requirements of this Regulation on a sub-consolidated basis may also be eligible, within the relevant limits, as Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the group on a consolidated basis, as the Common Equity Tier 1 capital of an intermediate financial holding company attributable to minority interests and the part of that same capital attributable to the parent company support both pari passu the losses of their subsidiaries when they occur. (39) The precise accounting technique to be used for the calculation of own funds, their adequacy for the risk to which an institution is exposed, and for the assessment of the concentration of exposures should take account of the provisions of Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial insti­ tutions ( 1 ), which incorporates certain adaptations of the provisions of Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 on consolidated accounts ( 2 ) or of Regu­ lation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards ( 3 ), whichever governs the accounting of the institutions under national law. (40) For the purposes of ensuring adequate solvency it is important to lay down capital requirements which weight assets and off-balance sheet items according to the degree of risk. (41) On 26 June 2004 the BCBS adopted a framework agreement on the international convergence of capital measurement and capital requirements ('Basel II frame­ work'). The provisions in Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC that this Regulation has taken over form an equivalent to the provisions of the Basel II framework. Consequently, by incorporating the supplementary elements of the Basel III framework this Regulation forms an equivalent to the provisions of the Basel II and III frameworks.

Article 253 Treatment of unrated positions 1. For the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of an unrated securitisation position an institution may apply the weighted-average risk weight that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures, multiplied by the concentration ratio referred to in paragraph 2. For this purpose, the institution shall know the composition of the pool of securitised exposures securitised at all times. 2.

The resulting risk weight shall not be higher than 1 250 % or lower than any risk weight applicable to a rated more senior tranche. Where the institution is unable to determine the risk weights that would be applied to the securitised exposures under Chapter 2, it shall apply a risk weight of 1 250 % to the position. Article 254 Treatment of securitisation positions in a second loss tranche or better in an ABCP programme Subject to the availability of a more favourable treatment for unrated liquidity facilities under Article 255 an institution may apply to securitisation positions meeting the following conditions a risk weight that is the greater of 100 % or the highest of the risk weights that would be applied to any of the securitised exposures under Chapter 2 by an institution holding the exposures: (a) the securitisation position shall be in a tranche which is economically in a second loss position or better in the securitisation and the first loss tranche shall provide mean­ ingful credit enhancement to the second loss tranche; (b) the quality of the securitisation position shall be equivalent to credit quality step 3 under the Standardised Approach or better; (c) the securitisation position shall be held by an institution which does not hold a position in the first loss tranche. Article 255 Treatment of unrated liquidity facilities 1.

Review procedures shall aim at finding and limiting errors associated with model weaknesses. Human judgements shall take into account all relevant information not considered by the model. The institution shall document how human judgement and model results are to be combined. Article 175 Documentation of rating systems 1. The institutions shall document the design and operational details of its rating systems. The documentation shall provide evidence of compliance with the requirements in this Section, and address topics including portfolio differentiation, rating criteria, responsibilities of parties that rate obligors and exposures, frequency of assignment reviews, and management oversight of the rating process. 2. The institution shall document the rationale for and analysis supporting its choice of rating criteria. An institution shall document all major changes in the risk rating process, and such documentation shall support identification of changes made to the risk rating process subsequent to the last review by the competent authorities. The organisation of rating assignment including the rating assignment process and the internal control structure shall also be documented. 3. The institutions shall document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure consistency with the definitions set out in this Regulation. 4. Where the institution employs statistical models in the rating process, the institution shall document their methodol­ ogies. This material shall: (a) provide a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and mathematical and empirical basis of the assignment of estimates to grades, individual obligors, exposures, or pools, and the data source(s) used to estimate the model; (b) establish a rigorous statistical process including out-of-time and out-of-sample performance tests for validating the model; (c) indicate any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively. 5. An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the requirements of this Article are met, where an institution has obtained a rating system, or model used within a rating system, from a third-party vendor and that vendor refuses or restricts the access of the institution to information pertaining to the methodology of that rating system or model, or underlying data used to develop that methodology or model, on the basis that such information is proprietary. Article 176 Data maintenance 1. Institutions shall collect and store data on aspects of their internal ratings as required under Part Eight. 2. For exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks, and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3), institutions shall collect and store: (a) complete rating histories on obligors and recognised guar­ antors; (b) the dates the ratings were assigned; (c) the key data and methodology used to derive the rating; (d) the person responsible for the rating assignment; (e) the identity of obligors and exposures that defaulted; (f) the date and circumstances of such defaults; (g) data on the PDs and realised default rates associated with rating grades and ratings migration. 3.

        "content": "2. Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concen­ trations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected. 3. The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected. 4. The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are re-balanced at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption. 5. The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed. 6. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months. 7. The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an insti­ tution's internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securiti­ sation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions. Article 375 Recognition of hedges in the internal IRC model 1. Hedges may be incorporated into an institution's internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks. Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge's maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instru­ ments. An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event. 2. For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strat­ egies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the insti­ tution: (a) chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions; (b) demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement; (c) demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies shall be reflected in the own funds requirement. Article 376 Particular requirements for the internal IRC model 1. The internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options, structured credit derivatives and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes.

CHAPTER 2 Own funds requirements for position risk S e c t i o n 1 G e n e r a l p r o v i s i o n s a n d s p e c i f i c i n s t r u m e n t s Article 326 Own funds requirements for position risk The institution's own funds requirement for position risk shall be the sum of the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of its positions in debt and equity instruments. Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments. Article 327 Netting 1. The absolute value of the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calcu­ lating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 328 to 330. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 336. 2. No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the like­ lihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines. 3. All net positions, irrespective of their signs, shall be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggre­ gation. Article 328 Interest rate futures and forwards 1. Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table. 2. For the purposes of this Article, 'long position' means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and 'short position' means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future. Article 329 Options and warrants 1. Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.

EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following: (a) positions in contracts maturing on the same date; (b) positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates. 3. The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band. 4. That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position. 5. The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following: (a) the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity; (b) the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity; EN L 176/214 Official Journal of the European Union 27.6.2013"

    "answer": "Institutions may use residential and commercial immovable property as eligible collateral when two conditions are met: (1) the value of the property does not materially depend upon the credit quality of the obligor, and (2) the risk of the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but rather on the borrower's capacity to repay the debt from other sources. This means the repayment shouldn't materially depend on cash flow generated by the property serving as collateral.",

        "content": "2. Unless otherwise specified under Article 124(2), insti­ tutions may use as eligible collateral residential property which is or will be occupied or let by the owner, or the beneficial owner in the case of personal investment companies, and commercial immovable property, including offices and other commercial premises, where both the following conditions are met: (a) the value of the property does not materially depend upon the credit quality of the obligor. Institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the property and the performance of the borrower from their determination of the materiality of such dependence; (b) the risk of the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources, and as a consequence the repayment of the facility does not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral. 3. Institutions may derogate from point (b) of paragraph 2 for exposures secured by residential property situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published evidence showing that a well- developed and long-established residential property market is present in that territory with loss rates that do not exceed any of the following limits: (a) losses stemming from loans collateralised by residential property up to 80 % of the market value or 80 % of the mortgage-lending-value, unless otherwise provided under Article 124(2), do not exceed 0,3 % of the outstanding loans collateralised by residential property in any given year; (b) overall losses stemming from loans collateralised by resi­ dential property do not exceed 0,5 % of the outstanding loans collateralised by residential property in any given year. Where either of the conditions in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph is not met in a given year, institutions shall not use the treatment set out in that subparagraph until both conditions are satisfied in a subsequent year. 4. Institutions may derogate from point (b) of paragraph 2 for commercial immovable property situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published evidence showing that a well- developed and long-established commercial property market is present in that territory with loss rates that do not exceed any of the following limits: (a) losses stemming from loans collateralised by commercial immovable property up to 50 % of the market value or 60 % of the mortgage-lending-value do not exceed 0,3 % of the outstanding loans collateralised by commercial immovable property in any given year; (b) overall losses stemming from loans collateralised by commercial immovable property do not exceed 0,5 % of the outstanding loans collateralised by commercial immovable property in any given year. Where either of the conditions in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph is not met in a given year, institutions shall not use the treatment set out in that subparagraph until both conditions are satisfied in a subsequent year. 5. Institutions may use as eligible collateral amounts receivable linked to a commercial transaction or transactions with an original maturity of less than or equal to one year. Eligible receivables do not include those associated with secu­ ritisations, sub-participations or credit derivatives or amounts owed by affiliated parties. 6. Competent authorities shall permit an institution to use as eligible collateral physical collateral of a type other than those indicated in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 where all the following conditions are met: (a) there are liquid markets, evidenced by frequent transactions taking into account the asset type, for the disposal of the collateral in an expeditious and economically efficient manner. Institutions shall carry out the assessment of this condition periodically and where information indicates material changes in the market; (b) there are well-established, publicly available market prices for the collateral. Institutions may consider market prices as well-established where they come from reliable sources of information such as public indices and reflect the price of the transactions under normal conditions. Institutions may consider market prices as publicly available, where these prices are disclosed, easily accessible, and obtainable regularly and without any undue administrative or financial burden; (c) the institution analyses the market prices, time and costs required to realise the collateral and the realised proceeds from the collateral; EN 27.6.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 176/127"
